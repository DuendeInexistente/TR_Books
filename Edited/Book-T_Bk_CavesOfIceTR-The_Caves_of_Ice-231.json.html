The Caves of Ice

Thoran Frosthammer swung his axe at the log, each blow followed by the whisper of snow falling around him, the familiar rhythm lulling him into daydreaming. When he grew older (And larger; Thoran was quite proud of his size in the simple way only young boys can be) he would use his axe to rescue villages from impending doom, like the warrior on the sky. It'd appear soon enough, and he looked forward to that every year more than he did to the first warm day of sun's dawn.

At some point a cold breeze made him shudder, breaking him out of his fantasies, and he realized he would sun struggle to see his own hands before him, he hadn't packed any lights, and perhaps most direly, his mother had told him not to be too late. Rushing, he tied the wood he had cut in a bundle and threw that over his shoulder, his axe in the other and eyeing the road warily as he walked: He wasn't so familiar with this part of the forest, but the roads closer to home didn't have enough this season, and his father grew too old to walk too far, so he'd taken it upon himself to pick up the slack.

As the sky grew darker, he had to walk more slowly but grew more sure, the first stars helping guide him. Maybe one of them belonged to the warrior, he thought, and it'd lend him strength. The dusk grew colder, his sweat was freezing, and his hand holding the axe handle was starting to hurt, but he felt he would've failed as a nord if he let himself shake, so he tried not to. How long had he spent lost in his thoughts? The weight of his bundle was quickly growing from a source of pride to concern, not to mention pain in his hand and shoulder.

 "You're a nord.", he told himself, and willed it that that be that. He continued to march, glad he'd marked a trees on the way with large, gaping blows of his axe like his father had taught him. The resin was frozen on a few. "You're a nord."

He was a nord, and a very cold one, and as the last word escaped his mouth he heard something.

It was too scary to be a snicker, so the thought didn't cross his mind. He looked over his shoulder quickly, but willed himself to move before even turning his head back. It surely was a branch swaying, because he was nowhere near a city, and nobody would just... be behind him, at this time of the day, and not ask for help or offer it. Why had it sounded so much like a person? He didn't want to know and stepped faster, not quite running yet, because he was no coward. He was a warrior. Impending doom happened to villagers, not warriors, or even warriors-to-be.

He kept walking at a brisk pace for a while and was beginning to question if he'd really heard anything when he saw two small, glittering things a ways to his side, reflecting moonlight. He'd noticed it before and kept looking at it without realizing, and a contour drew itself against the backdrop as he drew closer until it turned from an odd shape to a figure. Someone, or something, so terribly misshapen he couldn't make it out as something living at first; living things have symmetry, this had either a terribly misshapen ribcage or an indeterminate amount of arms.

It was waiting for him to pass by, and it was looking directly at him. Thoran stopped moving, shocked by the twisted shape and by its stillness in equal measure. It didn't seem to care about the raising wind. It didn't seem to care about the cold. It just stood there like a statue, the sway of its labored breathing the only indication that it was alive.

And then the wind relented, and he heard another snicker behind him.

Thoran started running, too scared to think of dropping the bundle or the axe, and too scared for it to mater. His legs pumped anyways, his whole body rippling as the forest awoke all around him. Ahead of him, wildlife rustled and awoke and ran, clearing away from either the running nord boy or the increasing amount of footsteps behind him. Birds yelled as he passed, warning that none of this dare threaten the chicks in their nests, and more and more branches broke as the horde behind him ended the game and began the chase in earnest.

His lungs burned and his whole body pushed, his shoulders hitting trunks and branches, the panic ending all thought and leaving him acting on his most basic instinct: to follow the axe blows, to reach home, and to hide between his mother's arms until it dispelled the horrors. After some time he felt something barely touch his shoulder and grab him at just the right time to turn the run into a stumble, and his body took over. Without stopping his motion, he let whatever had grabbed him hold his weight and spun on his other feet, turning his whole body and swinging the so very heavy bundle of logs. It struck, something made a wet thud, and he stumbled back into a run, all the lighter now without the bundle.

He kept running, starting to put some distance between him and his chasers, daring to hope he'd outrun them, wanting to drop the axe too but too afraid of being defenseless. The moon  grew higher and higher on the sky, making the marks on the trunks harder to see, but he was also reaching an area of the forest he knew better. The brook where he'd stumbled, the tree with a funny shape on the trunk that, until recently, he'd wondered why it made his father crack a smile. He was close enough to home that the path he was following was the one his family had made, and he felt hope. He might just lose them, and he wanted to cry. Before long, he saw light through the branches. And before long, his father was asking what had him so scared and guiding him in, giving wary looks to the forest before closing the door and, without a moment's thought, barring the door, Thoran's mother giving his father his spear.

Thoran couldn't speak clearly, couldn't tell his father about the sounds he could barely hear now but still recognized, growing louder, and the thought that filled his mind was too laden with guilt to say out loud: He might've lost them, but he'd kept running in a straight line. He told himself that as much as his knees weren't the same his father was a mighty warrior and his shoulders were still just as strong if not stronger than when he'd been young, because if he didn't, he might've had to dwell on the fact he'd guided the horde home.
