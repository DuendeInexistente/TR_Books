While it is less adventurous than the Nibenese kitchen, it would be unwise to dismiss this local cuisine as boorish or simple -- after all, this is the same plain, uncomplicated fare that fed the Legions during their great conquests.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n***<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHighlands Grouts<BR>\\r\\nThe Colovian way to break the fast is sparse, but invigorating. This porridge is enjoyed with different additions depending on local customs: apple slices, salted cod, dried fish, wine, raw eggs, boiled poppad gourd pulp, and grapes are all common additions, as are spices such as Rihad pepper, muscat, or even some saffron.<BR>\\r\\nA cup of crushed ironrye<BR>\\r\\nA cup of fresh goat milk<BR>\\r\\nSome honey<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of salt<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn a small pot, add the oats, goat milk, honey, and salt together. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat. Allow the porridge to simmer softly until the crushed grains are soft and tender, and the milk has thickened.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIronrye is a hardy type of grain common in the west. Those familiar with other grains should be mindful that ironrye is tough and generally takes longer to soften. The addition of honey or another sweetener is advisable, as the grain by itself is rather bland.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n***<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nLyco Stew<BR>\\r\\nThe dark lycovine is family of the nightshade, but do not let this discourage you: the lycoae of the West Weald are delicious both cold and cooked. Lyco stew is a traditional meal from the city of Sarchal, commonly eaten on rice or bread. Some may object to the use of goat meat: try substituting with mutton.<BR>\\r\\nTwo cups of spike rice<BR>\\r\\nA lump of lard<BR>\\r\\nOne large onion<BR>\\r\\nTwo carrots<BR>\\r\\nSome garlic<BR>\\r\\nA fresh, spicy plena pepper<BR>\\r\\nA flank of goat meat, slightly aged<BR>\\r\\nA cup of Colovian wine<BR>\\r\\nThree lycoae, pureed<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of salt<BR>\\r\\nSome Colovian hard cheese, grated or crushed<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBoil the spike rice in water. Season with a pinch of salt. Let the rice boil softly for about half an hour while you prepare the rest of the meal.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHeat the lard in a pan to melt it down. Chop the onion, carrots, garlic, and plena pepper, and cook them until fragrant. Chop the goat meat into small chunks and brown it in the pan for a minute, then add a cup of wine. Once fragrant, add the pureed lycoae. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, about half an hour. Season with more salt. Drain the rice, then add the stew on top. Sprinkle with cheese.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n***<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDurenta with Fish and Eggs<BR>\\r\\nThe small red kernels of the durata stalk are a staple of the western seaboard. Durenta is porridge-like dish made from roughly ground, dried durata kernels. While the durata stalk was introduced by the Redguards, this recipe is purely Colovian.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nGround down durata meal can be hard to get outside of Colovia, but many soldiers receive it in care packages from their families back home -- maybe ask around a local garrison, or make it yourself by drying durate kernels in the sun, then powdering them with a mortar and pestle.<BR>\\r\\nHalf a cup of powdered durata kernels<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of salt<BR>\\r\\nSome garlic, to taste<BR>\\r\\nDried fish<BR>\\r\\nA bit of olive oil<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of powdered muscat<BR>\\r\\nTwo eggs<BR>\\r\\nA handful of chopped olives<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBring salted water to a boil, then pour in the durata powder while stirring briskly. Once the mixture is smooth and thick, keep it warm for about half an hour. Meanwhile, chop up the dried fish and garlic, then fry them together with some olive oil. Spice with muscat.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOnce the gruel is almost done, crack the eggs into the pan with the fish and garlic. While the eggs are cooking, scoop the durenta into bowls, and season liberally with Rihad pepper. Toss the fish and eggs on top, and finish with some fresh olives and perhaps some crushed cheese.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n***<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Grandpa Goat in Garlic Sauce\"\\r\\nA meal of great nostalgic value to anyone who grew up in Colovia, this whimsically named feast is eaten on holidays like Tibedetha or the New Life Festival. Throughout Cyrodiil, goat tends to be the meat of choice for the poor: goats can thrive on nearly anything, from the sparse grasses of the Colovian Highlands to the marshy herbs of the eastern mangroves.<BR>\\r\\nFor the goat:<BR>\\r\\nTwo heads of garlic<BR>\\r\\nTwo onions<BR>\\r\\nA handful of dried figs<BR>\\r\\nTwo carrots<BR>\\r\\nA cup of olive oil<BR>\\r\\nTwo cups of Colovian wine<BR>\\r\\nSome nigella seeds<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of salt and freshly ground Rihad pepper<BR>\\r\\nRib or loin goat chops, well aged<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nFor the garlic sauce:<BR>\\r\\nOne head of garlic<BR>\\r\\nA lump of lard<BR>\\r\\nA spoonful of flour<BR>\\r\\nA cup of goat milk<BR>\\r\\nA cup of thick broth<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of salt (preferably Sutchi)<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of Rihad pepper<BR>\\r\\nSome ground fennel seeds<BR>\\r\\nA cup of Colovian hard cheese, grated or crushed<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nChop the onions, figs, carrots, and about half of the garlic. Toss the olive oil, nigella, salt, pepper, and one cup of wine in an ample lidded pot or mixing bowl. The other cup of wine is traditionally used in a toast to Saint Potri, who is credited with inventing the dish while stuck in a wine cask.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nChop the goat meat into large pieces, then make small incisions along the flank. Clean the remaining garlic cloves and push them into the incisions. Add the meat to the bowl containing the oil and wine mixture, and make sure to toss it vigorously. Allow the meat to marinate overnight in a cool, dark place.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNow we can make the garlic sauce. Heat lard in a saucepan, then add the crushed and minced garlic. Bake until browned. Add the flour, and quickly mix it until fragrant. Add the goat milk and broth, and stir briskly. Allow the sauce to simmer for a little while. Add salt, Rihad pepper and ground fennel to taste. Finally, stir in the grated cheese until the sauce is smooth. Keep the garlic sauce warm on the side of the fire, while you finish preparing the meat.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDrain the goat chops. Heat more oil in an ample iron skillet, then brown the meat quickly on both sides. Allow the meat to cook through for another couple of minutes. Once the meat is to satisfaction, it can be presented alongside good Colovian bread or cooked spike rice, with garlic sauce on top and a sprinkling of crumbled cheese and garden herbs.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n***<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nColovian \"Battlewine\"<BR>\\r\\nThis mulled wine was originally served to warriors before battle. Ancient physicians claimed that it excites the blood and dulls fear -- potentially due to the inclusion of raw mandrake root. Bottled battlewine is now sold in many places, but the best battlewine is still made at home.<BR>\\r\\nA bottle of Colovian wine<BR>\\r\\nAn apple<BR>\\r\\nSome honey<BR>\\r\\nA handful of blood-lily petals<BR>\\r\\nA small piece of mandrake root<BR>\\r\\nA couple of anise stars<BR>\\r\\nA pinch of ground cardamon seeds<BR>\\r\\nOne shot of Kurst (cherry liquor)<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nCombine the honey with a cup of water in a pot, then boil until the it has completely dissolved. Grind the blood lily petals and mandrake root together in a mortar. Omit mandrake for a less volatile drink. Reduce the heat and add the anise stars and cardamon alongside the mandrake mixture to the bowl. Cut the apple into parts and add it as well. Simmer until thickened.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nReduce the heat and add the wine. Let it softly simmer (not boil!) for a few hours. Strain and serve in tankards, adding a shot of Kurst at the very last moment (Kurst is a traditional Colovian cherry liquor -- if not available, any sharp, clear liquor will do.)<BR>",
