In that time, I have seen our Great House weather the tribulations of the time with a unique strength and determination. Indeed, our position is unique among the five Houses. House Indoril holds fast to the Temple, while House Redoran continues to arm itself for a war that will never come. House Dres was humbled by the Arnesian War, but rather than adapt to changing times, they still cling to their slaves and their crops, for they have nothing else. And the Telvanni magisters, as always, care little for what happens outside their fungal towers. After four centuries, Morrowind still remains, in the Imperial imagination, a second-rate backwater. While the other four Houses occupy themselves with their own concerns, only Hlaalu is left to build a prosperous future for this land as a true Imperial province.<BR><BR>\\r\\nSons of our House hold the throne in Mournhold and the dukedom in Vvardenfell. The Imperial Proconsul holds court with us in Narsis. The Empire is the future, and so is House Hlaalu. Yet despite our clear mandate to lead Morrowind into a new era of commerce and collaboration, House Hlaalu continues to be weighed down by conservative ideologies. We could instead become a beacon of high culture in this province. With our influence, we can bring not only the material riches of the rest of the Empire to Morrowind, but the cultural riches as well. Breton sculpture, Khajiiti tapestry, Nibenese philosophy, the greatest works of the greatest minds in Tamriel could flow through Narsis like the waters of the Thirr, if only we let them.<BR><BR>\\r\\nAnd the flow will not only be inward, but outward. The austere beauty, the synthesis of natural and artificial that defines Dunmer architecture and stonecraft is beyond compare, yet almost unheard of in the western Empire. This is not only a shame for the outlanders who will never experience the vibrant cultural heritage of this land, but also for our own citizens. A thriving marketplace for Dunmer art and culture would not only enrich the people of this province, but enrich the spirit of every citizen beyond our borders. We have a choice to make. In the great conversation that is the Empire, the Dunmer voice has been silent for too long. It falls to House Hlaalu to speak up. And when we speak, shall we speak only in defense of the Dunmer coinpurse? Or shall we speak also in defense of the Dunmer spirit, the Dunmer mind, the Dunmer worldview? Let us redouble our commitment to the arts in Morrowind and we shall deserve the position which fortune has given us.<BR><BR>\\r\\nEditor's Note: A patron of the arts, Councilor Curio is himself a known and celebrated dramatist. Currently occupied with his latest production, any interested investors or collaborators are encouraged to contact Councilor Curio directly at his manor in Hlaalu Canton, Vivec City. The editorial board thanks Councilor Curio for his generous contributions to the Echo.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
