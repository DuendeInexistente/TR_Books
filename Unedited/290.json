He gave me a contemptful look, but slowed his pack guars and his walk as he came to me. After staring at me like I was stupid for another minute or two, he finally spoke.<BR>\r\n\"Why are you naked, Nord?\" <BR> <BR>\r\nI was rather smug in my response. <BR>\r\n\"Ha! I know what you might think, Dark Elf,\" I said. \"You think I saw a comely lass or something, and not realizing she was a witch, I was tricked, hexed, and all my clothing stolen in my sleep.\" <BR>\r\n\"It is a rather common issue with you people.\" <BR>\r\n\"Oh ho! But you see, I am not an average stupid Nord,\" I said. \"I am an educated future noble, from the famous College of Winterhold.\" <BR>\r\n\"Uh huh. And what exactly do you study at the College?\" <BR>\r\n\"I'm the caretaker for the student dorms.\" <BR>\r\n\"I see.\" <BR>\r\n\"I read their books in the meantime when they aren't looking. Of course, I am not very good at reading. But I come from a very good pedigree. My father was executed by the Jarl, and my mother was five feet tall.\" <BR> <BR> \r\nRemyn simply stared at me for a few minutes. <BR> <BR>\r\n\"Why, pray tell, is this a good pedigree?\" <BR>\r\n\"Well, you see, my father was executed by the Jarl for mercantile fraud, the most wealthy form of crime there is. Surely this must reflect to his intelligence to commit such a profitable crime, no?\" <BR>\r\n\"No, it musn't. And your mother?\" <BR>\r\n\"Yes, she was five feet tall.\" <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI received another stare. Remyn looked away for a moment. He looked to me again.\r\n<BR> <BR>\r\n\"So, it was not a witch who fooled you. Why are you naked then?\" <BR>\r\n\"You see, there was a comely lass--\" <BR>\r\n\"Okay.\" <BR>\r\n\"--there was a comely lass at the tavern. I was visiting Fort Frostmoth, you see, because I was drowning at the time.\" <BR>\r\n\"You were drowning at the time.\" <BR>\r\n\"Yes, I was drowning, you see, because my boat had been destroyed by dreugh.\" <BR>\r\nHe paused. \"I don't understand.\" <BR>\r\n\"I set sail from Winterhold in a boat, you see, headed for Solitude for my cousin's wedding.\" <BR>\r\n\"I am not an expert on Skyrim. But is Dawnstar not west of Winterhold?\" <BR>\r\nI chuckled. \"Yes, and west I did go, Dark Elf. I've seen many maps in my time. West is to the left. So I sailed left, and would have arrived bright and early in Dawnstar, had it not been for the dreugh that attacked my boat.\" <BR>\r\n\"Wh--\" <BR>\r\n\"Once I was drowning, I simply used a scroll of Divine Intervention to arrive at Fort Frostmoth, where I caught a boat to Khuul. That's where I met the comely lass I mentioned.\" <BR>\r\n\"I see.\" <BR>\r\n\"Yes, and you see, here is the thing, and it should go to show you how educated I really am. You see, this comely lass, she was rumored by the locals to be a witch. And wouldn't it be just so expected and stereotypical of a Nord in Morrowind, to think that a woman is a witch just because she's a little unusual? And so I said, no, this woman is not a witch, and I will not be tricked or play into your stereotypes. And so, I went home with her to her odd little camp outside town.\" <BR>\r\n\"Her camp.\" <BR>\r\n\"Yes, had a lot of odd skulls and potions around. While I wasn't looking, some sort of hex was placed on me. I assume she fought as hard as she could to stop my assailant, but alas, I was knocked out, and all my possessions stolen, including my beloved axe, Niptickler.\" <BR>\r\n\"Niptickler.\" <BR>\r\n\"My beloved axe Niptickler.\" <BR>\r\n\"Nipt--\" Remyn stopped himself from speaking again. \"Okay. You seem a fool, but I am not without sympathy. If you wish, you may accompany me to Ald'Ruhn.\" <BR>\r\n\"Old Run, you say?\" <BR>\r\n\"Ald'Ruhn. That is a common Western misconception.\" <BR>\r\n\"Ah, you see, it is a common Eastern misconception that it's a common Western misconception.\" <BR> <BR>\r\nRemyn paused. <BR> <BR>\r\n\"That's called reverse psychology, you see,\" I said. <BR>\r\n\"There are some clothes in one of the guar's packs. Put something on,\" he said. \"Try not to embarrass me when we get there.\" <BR> <BR>\r\n****<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPublisher's Note:<BR>\r\nThe \"Dunce in Morrowind\" series, collected and edited by Frolja Silver-Blood, were originally assembled by the Sneezing Horker Historical Society in Winterhold. Winterhold, as a center of magical learning, is rather cosmopolitan for a city in the icy north.<BR>\r\nThe Sneezing Horker Historical Society saw its fair share of Dark Elven and Nordic members who were often violently astonished by the ignorance about their respective homelands.<BR>\r\nServing as an introduction to the Dunmer lands for the Society's Nordic members, the Dunce in Morrowind was a series of skits originally written by the late Ferana Adrethi and acted out by regular members to much laughter and drink.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"The Dunce\" can easily be found in Winterhold as one of all too many \"nobles\" residing in town as prospective College students. Full of bluster, arrogance, and a dash of cunning, they are as much part of the city as they are guaranteed income for the carpenter's guild.<BR>\r\n<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":150,"book_type":"Book","skill":"Illusion","enchantment":0}}
