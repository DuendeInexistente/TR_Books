It is the province's financial capital, with many outlander residents and visitors who come to conduct business with House Hlaalu. Hundreds of tourists are seen passing through the Grand Bazaar every day to purchase exotic Dunmeri wares, and locals often visit to purchase international merchandise. Most outlander business is conducted in the Foreign Quarter, with most native commoners living in the skyscrapers of St. Veloth Quarter. The Waterfront processes shipments going to and from the city, and the Market Quarter is where the majority of the city's shops are located. The Old Quarter and Council Quarter house the wealthiest citizens of Narsis and contain the main residences of Clan Hlaalu, as well as the Grand Council Hall and other official House locations. Surrounding the city are various manors and plantations, as well as the Narsis District Duke's residence in Riverkeep.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNarsis' six districts are centered on the Council Quarter mesa, with the Market Quarter below to the northwest, St. Veloth Quarter to the north, the Waterfront to the east, and the Old and Foreign Quarters to the south. Across the river, Riverkeep is south, Old Dren Plantation is southeast, and Vedas Plantation is east.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nMarket Quarter<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Market Quarter, Narsis' newest district, is located on the Purple Road to the northwest. Originally it was simply an informal day-market for caravaners and local farmers to gather; the Market Quarter grew into a full district post-Armistice as traders and travelers, who couldn't find room in the Foreign Quarter, built inns and houses to accommodate themselves. The population is a mix of Dunmer natives and outlanders. Among the important locations are the Mesa Exchange, the province's newest and only stock exchange, the multi-level Grand Bazaar, the Farmers and Laborers Hall, and the lavish manor of the Sixth Family of Clan Hlaalu. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nSt. Veloth Quarter<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Located directly north of the Council Quarter, St. Veloth Quarter (sometimes called St. Veloth's Square or simply St. Veloth's) is home to Narsis' working class population. In the First Era, the residents of Narsis' third-oldest district farmed the land of what is now the Market Quarter and Foreign Quarter or worked as boatmen plying the river. As House Hlaalu moved its people out into the former Waters March over the course of the Second Era, the population of St. Veloth's Square became poorer, a trend that continues into the current era. Important locations in this Quarter include the two giant apartment towers named the Velothi Tower and Brevur Heights. There is also the Morag Tong Hall and the guildhalls of the Miners and Tanners, the Tailors and Dyers, and the Cat Catchers. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nWaterfront<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Waterfront is Narsis' eastern district, built against the Council Quarter's cliffs at great expense by House Hlaalu. The Waterfront houses several local merchant companies, including the East Empire Company. The famous \"Merchant-Prince of Narsis\", Dravos Turil, owns a large shop in the Waterfront, and the Fortuna casino functions as the center of the city's red-light district. Other important locations include the Sailors and Shipbuilders Hall and the large manor of the Seventh Family of Clan Hlaalu.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nOld Quarter<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Old Quarter is, as the name suggests, the oldest continuously inhabited part of the city and is the smallest district in area. It is essentially a road located between the Council and Foreign Quarters. Much of the old nobility lives here, as well as some of the middle-class Dunmer who work directly for House Hlaalu. The First Family of House Hlaalu live in the oldest building in the city, a manor facing the entrance to the Council Quarter.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nCouncil Quarter<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Council Quarter is the center of governance for House Hlaalu, and contains the luxurious palace of the Second Family of Clan Hlaalu. This palace is the home of the Grandmaster of House Hlaalu, High Hlaalu Athires. Among other important locations are the Measurehall, which is the center of House business in the province, as well as the Imperial Consulate, the Eight-Bones Temple and the Arena.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nForeign Quarter<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Foreign Quarter is the southernmost district of Narsis. Before the Armistice, outlander merchants were only permitted to trade on the south flat, which was farmland tended by slaves that regularly flooded when the river swelled. Merchants profited so much from doing business directly in Narsis that a shack town was formed on the flat, becoming the original Foreign Quarter. Over the millenia it was gradually built into a part of the city proper. This district houses the Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, the Chapel of Zenithar, and the Narsis District's headquarters for the Imperial Legion, Heron Hall. The Foreign Quarter also holds the entrance to the expansive Narsis Catacombs.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nTransportation<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><IMG SRC=\"tr\

Good roads branch from the Purple Road leading north to the Coronati Basin and south around the Thirr River to Narsis' outskirts, which include the Duke's palace at Riverkeep, Old Dren Plantation and Vedas Plantation. The Purple Road itself leads west through Shipal-Sharai and Septim's Gate Pass to reach Cyrodiil. Silt strider service is available at the south edge of the Foreign Quarter, traveling from Narsis to Hlerynhul, Andrethis and Ald Horak. A guar cart near the Canyon Keep in the Market Quarter travels to Shipal-Sharai and Stormgate Pass. Ships from the docks at the Foreign Quarter travel to Hlerynhul, Sadrathim, and Othmura, and low-fare gondolas shuttle passengers around the city and outskirts via the Thirr river.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":3,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
