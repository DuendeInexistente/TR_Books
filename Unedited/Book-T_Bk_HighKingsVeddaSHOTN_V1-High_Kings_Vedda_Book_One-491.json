LET it be known that all writing is but a reflection of the Voice, murky and warped. Kyne's truth is in the throats of Her Children.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nII. The shape of the World is this:\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIII. The essence of life is Breath, Wind and the Voice, for so was Man breathed upon the land by Kyne and so does Man bear a fraction of that Breath within their breast.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIV. Man is of the Sky, a Child, whose truest expression is to be as the firmament: wild, mighty and all-encompassing. The Children of the Sky have a birthright to this land, and all others are interlopers. They were not breathed.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nV. The shape of the World is this:\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVI. There must always be Something, and there must always be Nothing, for which has meaning without the other?\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVII. Something sits below, ever creating and the death of the wild spirit. Look farther down than you can, and consider the depth of existence.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVIII. Nothing rests above, ever destroying and the death of the living body. Look farther up than you can, and consider the vastness of oblivion.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIX. Their place of meeting is the Sky, and it contains all possibility. Look around at all that you can, and be joyful.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nX. The shape of the World is this:\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nXI. All will be destroyed. ALDUIN is the Dragon, and the Dragon does not eat His tail.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nXII. The cycle of the Kalpa, of destruction and creation, of Nothing and Something, is all that exists in perpetuity.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nMeditate on this: Hope is eaten by the Dragon, and so there is no Hope. Act now, then, and with certainty forge the world.\\r\\n<BR> <BR>\\r\\n",
