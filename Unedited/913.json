Know the three points of cranial attack: eyes, nose, and temple.<BR><BR>\r\nNever strike with knee or elbow in honorable combat.<BR><BR>\r\nAlways begin in chambered position before executing a kick, so as not to betray one's intentions to one's opponent.<BR><BR>\r\nBalance and restraint are key. A master does not lose his form when his target is removed.<BR><BR>\r\nFlow from one movement to the next. A mechanical movement is the construct's weakness.<BR><BR>\r\nPray to your gods every day, thrice a day, to stay limber in spirit.<BR><BR>\r\nFor this one, an attack. For this one, a defense. Every movement is its own counter; wise pairing will set an opponent reeling.<BR><BR>\r\nLet your opponent's strength become yours. Resist by accepting. Counter by harmonizing.<BR><BR>\r\nThe best fight is the one that never happened.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":100,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
