It is he who shall punish any, sorcerer or spirit, who should reach above their rightful station or dishonor covenant in actions or thought. Miasma be the wretch's part.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nThe PERYITON, which contains the names, orders and offices of the Hosts of Misrule, their various knowledges, and the charms by which to bind them into visible aspect.\r\n<BR> <BR>\r\nVOLUME 4: DEMONS OF THE NORTH <DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\peryiton_herma.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\r\nThe Prince HERMAEUS MORA or HERMA or HERMUZ or MORA or MORAEIS is the crowned demon of the northern void. He appears in many shifting forms, but will choose one if ordered by the worthy. Speaking in a soothing voice, he teaches all secrets aetherial, lunar, or mundane, often asking another secret in return. He can be convinced to answer truthfully concerning all past or future matters. <BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\peryiton_xarxes.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\r\nXARXES or SARSIS or ZARCASTES is a chamberlain of the northern void and appears as an old man or scribe. Favoring sorcerers of elvish stock, he teaches philosophy and history and reveals the conjurer's lineage from dawntide to the present. <BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\peryiton_oghma.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\r\nOGHMA or OGMAHA or OGAMA or OGO is a marchioness of the northern void. She appears as a beautiful woman, a book, or both. She can make the conjurer learned in all mundane arts and sciences and the lesser magics. <BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\peryiton_mephala.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\r\nThe Prince MEPHALA or MARFALA or MAPHAT is the crowned demon of the northeastern void. She appears as a black spider with two heads, both a woman and a man. She is known to be a good natured Prince, but will only speak in lies. When properly courted she reveals if the sorcerer's life is being plotted against but also tempts honest people to carry hidden blades on their person and to poison their lovers. Once summoned she won't leave the sorcerer's side until she has lured either them or someone in their vicinity into a trap.\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\peryiton_paruddma.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\r\nPARUDDMA or RUS'HA-PARMA is a forlorn smith of the northeastern void and appears as an old, frail mer draped in the carcass of a Dreugh-Prince. Upon an examination of the one who summons him, he will either stay in his fragile state and disperse into the air or melt into the carcass and attack nimbly with many daggers. After a fair--and in his own opinion fun--fight, he will rest his arms down on the ground and teach the secrets of enchanting and binding the souls of Dremora into mundane weaponry.\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\peryiton_meridia.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\r\nThe Prince MERIDIA or MIRDIS or MERDINE is the crowned demon of the northwestern void and appears as a winged sorceress. She loathes darkness, death and decay or anything that reminds her of the fragility of mortal lives. Thus she will take great offence if summoned at night or near a place of burial or a mortuary. She teaches the art of healing and illuminating the shadows.\r\n<BR> <br>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":200,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
