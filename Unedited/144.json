ASTERION, KING OF BULLS<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\nNow in those days the brothers and sisters of Belharza were the minotaurs. They were many, and had many children, and they did not yet shun the cities of men for the wild and distant places. They were wise and strong, having been taught by their father, Morihaus. And of all the minotaurs the ruler was Asterion, who behaved not as a servant of Empire, but as a solitary king of his kind, and they loved and feared him. Asterion was once a hero of renown, who fought the winged hordes of Ayleidoon by the side of his brother Belharza, and built many bridges over the Niben. But in old age his flesh had become white, his mind had become clouded, and his desire was for the red power that is the right of kings alone.<BR>\n<BR>\nMournful day, Belharza's death! Our banners we burned, and our faces we covered in ash, and ash we poured into the river until the red waters turned black. The brothers and sisters of Belharza, the bullish spawn of Morihaus and Aleshut, came to the city and mourned, and their king, Asterion, came to the city and mourned. But the heart of Asterion was not on his tongue, for he had seen the Ruby-of-Kings, clasped in the cold left hand of Belharza, so mighty still in death.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe children of Belharza then gathered at the catafalque to hold a banquet round his silent remains (as was the custom in those days), and Asterion was present in a place of honor. And when the last dregs of bitter wine were poured on the ground, Belharza's oldest child came forth, her name was Belmar, and she spoke the words of peace, saying: \"Sisters and brothers, mourn not for the passing of Belharza, for he was Emperor, and by Divine pact his name is now bound to the Ruby-of-Kings. Forever he will stand by and give wise council. See how it glows with star-made splendor! While this stone lies in the hand of the line of Mori-Alesh, our Empire will grow, and will come to encompass, in time, all things, the lands of the west, and the lands of the east, nations above, and nations below, an empire of Man, eternal, fixed between the stars. Now of all here present I am firstborn, and claim the right of Empire.\"<BR>\n<BR>\nBut Asterion roared, dissenting: \"The line of Morihaus has grown weak through the blood of the north! Its children have become small and weak, sleeping in silk! Is this the blood of the pennate bull, who slew many Elves, who defied Merid-Nua and cast down the shrines, who taught the bees to make honey in remembrance of the blood he spilled? My line is the true blood of the bull, and I claim Empire.\"<BR>\n<BR>\nSaid Belmar: \"You may have the blood of Morihaus, bull-uncle, but of the blood of Aleshut, the mother, you know nothing. Powerful mother of man, her love is so great that it protects her children from all harm. Many are the spears our enemies have raised against us, yet these weapons did us no harm, they pierced us, but drew no blood. No weapon of man may harm the children of Esha, likewise, none of the children of Esha would ever harm one another.\"<BR>\n<BR>\r\nBut Asterion, who was likewise a child of the Mother, had no such injunction. He gored Belmar with his great horns, which was kin-bone to Belmar, and deadly. And the servants of Asterion did likewise to the children of Belharza, until all were dead. And Asterion ordered all of them burned, and their bones ground to dust, so that none could from them fashion a weapon to harm him. Then Asterion Usurper left the City, and journeyed to the valley of Horns, where he held his court.<BR>\n<BR>\n\n\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":200,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
