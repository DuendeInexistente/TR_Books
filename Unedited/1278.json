The former general Casik - who briefly and illegally ruled Ebonheart as his personal fief during the chaotic years of the Imperial Simulacrum - has been revealed to be a daedric imposter, and slain. Ebonheart's noble Minister of Justice, Belisatha Mede, cited the vital assistance of a capable %PCRace %PCClass in finally putting the thirty-year-old case to rest. Citizens are encouraged to bring any information about surviving associates of the demon general to the authorities, and to be ever-vigilant against the ongoing threat of Tharnite plots.<br><br>",
