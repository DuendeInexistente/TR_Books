As<BR>\\r\\nI searched for exit, a figure<BR>\\r\\nAppeared to me, she spoke<BR>\\r\\nIn an old tongue, and as<BR>\\r\\nThe slaps of fire nearly reached<BR>\\r\\nMe, she burst into a torrent<BR>\\r\\nOf water, and I flowed with<BR>\\r\\nHer into the turbent sea.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: Sire your town square is<BR>\\r\\nCollapsed from the fires<BR>\\r\\nYou have risen from. But<BR>\\r\\nAll can be rebuilt, a tranquil<BR>\\r\\nCatch you were to our<BR>\\r\\nDisturbed thoughts last night.<BR>\\r\\nI regret to tell you that our stay<BR>\\r\\nMust now end, but thankfully not<BR>\\r\\nOf a mournful day. Our ships<BR>\\r\\nShall be set and we must go.<BR>\\r\\n(To Banthas)<BR>\\r\\nSome foul play is still afoot,<BR>\\r\\nAnd we must flee from its<BR>\\r\\nStone sure foot.<BR>\\r\\nEad: Your ships have been washed away,<BR>\\r\\nThe bay must have swallowed them<BR>\\r\\nIn the storm last night,<BR>\\r\\nFor the ports are barren today.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: My lord, if that is so, our men<BR>\\r\\nShall have no other choice than to<BR>\\r\\nCross the Wrothgar gap.<BR>\\r\\nEad: My home is safe, you know<BR>\\r\\nNot what you walk into. This<BR>\\r\\nLand is still wilderness that <BR>\\r\\nEven my men do not venture to.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: We travel light and near to homeland bay,<BR>\\r\\n(aside) To steer away from or fortune delay.<BR>\\r\\nEad: Then to Daggerfall you are found<BR>\\r\\nTill the time of our interests waxed.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: Hail High Rock<BR><BR>\\r\\n(Exit Gothyrd and Attendants)<BR>\\r\\nEad: I must ask for time with Marithyn,<BR>\\r\\nThere is much healing needed.<BR>\\r\\n(Exit all except Eadwyre and Marithyn)<BR><BR>\\r\\nMar: My lord, your palor and demeanor<BR>\\r\\nIs not of normal structure.<BR>\\r\\n(aside) Perhaps his visions were not<BR>\\r\\nOf ale and grog set.<BR>\\r\\nEad: Marithyn, my closest friend, I have<BR>\\r\\nMore of my visions that I did not<BR>\\r\\nDispose with the court. The lady<BR>\\r\\nPresented herself to me, she was<BR>\\r\\nKynareth. She warned me<BR>\\r\\nOf the growing swarm of Skyrim.<BR>\\r\\nShe blessed me of water and<BR>\\r\\nAsked of me to invade the east,<BR>\\r\\nAnd by Akatosh I would be invincible.<BR>\\r\\nMar: Devine will do not be tampered<BR>\\r\\nWhen did the goddess proclaim our victory?<BR>\\r\\nEad: By mid-year celebration we shall<BR>\\r\\nReign the highest rock of Tamriel.<BR>\\r\\nMar: But how my lord? Our forces<BR>\\r\\nAre depleted of the Orsinium region.<BR>\\r\\nEad: We shall use the empire funds to raise<BR>\\r\\nAn army, and with our sister and<BR>\\r\\nCameron of the red sands we shall<BR>\\r\\nMarch our flag into Snowhawk.<BR>\\r\\nMar: How will we convince Lysandus<BR>\\r\\nTo relieve funds he risked overthrow for<BR>\\r\\nTo join league with the sand viper?<BR>\\r\\nEad: Tonight, on his journey home, Gothyrd<BR>\\r\\nShall come upon a broken passage. He<BR>\\r\\nShall fall victim to the navigation of<BR>\\r\\nThe Gro-Kar Forest. To Lysandus shall<BR>\\r\\nBe sent the notice of a barbarian ambush<BR>\\r\\nThat has stolen the prince. With much of his<BR>\\r\\nForces missing he will call upon Sentinel<BR>\\r\\nFor arms and will grant us of our monetary needs.<BR>\\r\\nMar: Gothyrd will find his way of the tangled<BR>\\r\\nForest, then what shall excuse us?<BR>\\r\\nEad: By then my lady's will shall be done.<BR>\\r\\nAnd all disease is cured<BR>\\r\\nIn the balms of victory.<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\nScene II<BR>\\r\\nGothyrd's men have nearly reached the peaks mount.<BR><BR>\\r\\nGoth: Banthas, do you see the cliffs of Cauisian<BR>\\r\\nThere to the north, blocking the route to Skyrim.<BR>\\r\\nBan: Yes my lord, I walked the valley<BR>\\r\\nOf Wrothgar in the small campaigns of Haafinheim.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: Do you believe the story of the mouths?<BR>\\r\\nThat as the first of our kind came here,<BR>\\r\\nWithin that divide a thousand were killed<BR>\\r\\nBy the voices of 3?<BR>\\r\\nBan: I believe it, and I live to reconcile it sire.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: How powerful they were,<BR>\\r\\nYet in their turbulence<BR>\\r\\nNo wake was left in their absence.<BR>\\r\\nTo where does Akatosh send such spirits?<BR>\\r\\nWhat can be said at the death of gods?<BR>\\r\\nBan: Even these granite walls are<BR>\\r\\nFaced to the wind, and one<BR>\\r\\nDay shall be of a grain of sand.<BR>\\r\\nMen are forgot, but tales remembered.<BR>\\r\\nTales are lost but their stones recovered.<BR>\\r\\nWhat then of when the stones fall?<BR>\\r\\nThen the truth is lost.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: These stones may last until<BR>\\r\\nThe end still, and will tell their story.<BR><BR>\\r\\n(Enter Messenger scout)<BR>\\r\\nMess: My lord, the west walls casts<BR>\\r\\nThe storm's pale winter corona.<BR>\\r\\nOur light shall only last<BR>\\r\\nA length of one degree,<BR>\\r\\nShall we descend?<BR>\\r\\nGoth: We descend tonight to reach<BR>\\r\\nOur kind post of no delay.<BR>\\r\\n(Exit Messenger scout)<BR><BR>\\r\\nBan: My lord, this land will<BR>\\r\\nBe no kin tonight. The guards can<BR>\\r\\nNot continue this, nor can you.<BR>\\r\\nGoth: A great rising of ancient air<BR>\\r\\nSurfaces between the bricks of Wayrest,<BR>\\r\\nWhich looms over my conscious<BR>\\r\\nAs the shadow of these mountains<BR>\\r\\nFrom the cold dying sun.<BR><BR>\\r\\n(Banthas falls back until he watches guard behind the soldiers.)<BR><BR>\\r\\nBan: These times are not lost<BR>\\r\\nTo one who has seen so many<BR>\\r\\nOf less fervor. The prince<BR>\\r\\nDoes not know the post to<BR>\\r\\nWhich he leads us, the night's<BR>\\r\\nSea will sink us to its endless depths.<BR>",
