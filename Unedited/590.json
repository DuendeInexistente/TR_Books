This text, found in the margins of one of the Piukanda scrolls, probably comes closest: it is thought to be a children's fable, shedding a modicum of light on the origin of the Ayleid.]<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn times past we were as the birds. The birds lived on an island which was eight; it was surrounded by a lake that was as if eight; it was surrounded by a jungle that was as if eight.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birds knew no arts; they knew no crafts. They did not build; they lived under starlit benevolence. They knew no fire; they were warmed by blessings (eight). They did not write; they knew not speech; they knew to sing pleasing songs; they knew to listen to the stars; they knew to repeat them.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThere on the far shores they were the people of Man. They were many (eight) and ruled in the jungle; the jungle was of their design; the jungle is loathsome. They knew to command the serpents of the lake; they knew to implore the beasts of the jungle; which they did by craft and not art.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of Man hated the birds and conspired to destroy them with fire. Many times (eight) they besieged the island which was eight; many birds were killed; the birds knew no arts; they knew no crafts.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the Pilot; he sailed on a white ship. The Pilot was called Torval; because he was a seeker and he came from the west. The Pilot was charmed by the friendly bird people who welcomed him; they sang in a voice that repeated whatever they heard; not understanding.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nTo thank them for their hospitality the Pilot taught the birds the secret of language. Language is a great thing; language is the greatest thing. Language means all arts and all crafts; and all of writing and the alphabet; and all that can be said and sung; and all of culture and civilization; every white tower and every ceremony; theories and philosophies; the work of many and the work of the great that did cause empire to spring forth and bind the jungle and its unworthy creatures; how to make lights that are stars and spears that one may wield in starlit splendor; to build altars to the gods and ancestors (eight); to discern what is worthy and what is unworthy; and transmute unworthy matter; to build; to rule; to speak power; to be Ayleidoon.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birds were very happy with the great gift of the Pilot who was called Torval. They gave him a great gift of the island which was eight; they made promise of friendship and loyalty in the new language.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with language the birds were much stronger than the people of Man; they knew how to kill the serpents of the lake; they knew how to charm the beasts of the jungle better and set them against the people of Man. And the birds were happy; they built many houses (eight) on the land which now belonged to them; and this was Ayleidoon. <BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n",
