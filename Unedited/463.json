In the first days of the apotheosis of ALMSIVI, Resdayn, weary from war and famine, was at peace. As is the nature of such a state, this did not last long and war was brought forth from lesser House Ra'Athim and noble House Oroynyon. The war was waged over a mine which was rumored to be laden with costly adamantium. Not long after the first ore had been found in the dark depths of the cavern, the two Houses warred over the lands that surrounded the mine, and the blood of father and son was shed for naught.<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nNot days after this war had begun, a small Dunmer girl, living only a few cities away from the battle, came forward. She had healed a pauper who had gone limp, and cured an elderly priest of the Tribunal Temple of his disease. With much appreciation, she was offered meats, garments, and gold. She humbly offered up all these gifts to the Temple and said she wished only to be remembered as a true faithful of Ayem, Vehk, and Seht.<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nAs the years dragged on, so did the battle. As a young woman, Saint Meris traversed the countryside, healing the sick farmers. It is said that she spoke these words once to a son of House Sul, who questioned why she would care so much for a mere farmer. \"There are many things I could do such as fight off the invaders in the North, or charge people to come to me and be healed in my own chapel inside a populous city. But the besiegers and the besieged in a well-populated city have an abundance of saltrice and cattle. They have their own places of refuge. Peasants do not. I will heal anyone, so long as it is the will of ALMSIVI.\"<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nIn her travels in the country, she came across a dying elderly Dunmer on her death bed. She praised Saint Meris and brought forth a white robe, the last homespun in her last days. With her final, elegant, breath, she thanked Saint Meris for her prayers and asked that she not heal her, for she knew her time had come. Saint Meris mourned over the dead body and blessed her family with righteous words and swore to wear the robe forever after as testament to all who sought the virtues of life. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nAfter she had grown into a woman, she went back to her homestead where her powers had first manifested themselves. She learned of the war that the Houses had waged before she began her holy patronage and went off to put an end to the slaughter. Upon the eleventh day of her pilgrimage, she espied the camps of Ra'Athim and Oroynyon and the grounds where the battle had been fought for so many years and was awed by the sight. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nMen, old and young, were killing their brothers and neighbors, Bodies piled upon each other were cast aside in shallow trenches that now overran with rivers of blood. With no sign of ceasing, Saint Meris took up the strength of Vehk and the mercy of Ayem and the wisdom of Seht and walked the battlefield, her white robe shining like a beacon on the fields of blood and misery. She began healing anyone she found wounded or near death. Caring not which House they owed fealty, she traversed the land, paying no attention to the men who marveled at her courage.<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\n\"Unarmed, and on this hallowed ground where we fight with one another day in and day out. She heals all and fears none,\" the leader of House Ra'Athim said to his men.<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nThe gray skies broke, and blue skies and gleaming sunshine tore through the clouds, encompassing the soldiers in the revealing light of ALMSIVI. They acknowledged her and realized that the generations-long slaughter was worthless. The Lords of House Ra'Athim rode out to the middle of the field, ready to surrender, when they saw the chap'thil of House Oroynyon already there, their weapons shattered. The two Houses pledged to stop the war and to share the wealth of the adamantium mine. They both thanked Saint Meris and adopted her white robe of peace and healing into their Houses as a sign of their gratitude. House Dunmer has since adopted her white robe.<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nBefore her death, Saint Meris continued to heal anyone without need of tribute. Her selflessness and her mercy exemplify the traits of the Tribunal Temple so much that once she passed on, she was made into a saint and was praised by many for her deeds. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nThose who wish to seek the love of peace would follow the acts of Saint Meris, and think for the whole of the land. The mercy in her voice whispers and the ears of the infidels open. Those who would follow the path of Saint Meris would act upon others before themselves, and care not for faction or race.<BR> ","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":50,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
