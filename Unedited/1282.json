Nominally a society of \"businessmer\" championing Dark Elf interests, Camonna operatives smuggle chartered goods and slaves by the boatful, and casually murder anyone who might pose a threat to their criminal enterprise. With the comparatively restrained and principled Thieves' Guild decapitated, a dark cloud descends over the Imperial province of Morrowind as the Camonna Tong's brutality lowers the standards of decency even among criminals.<br><br>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
