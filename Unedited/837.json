She and several others had volunteered to guard those who died during the exodus from Summerset, rather than letting them be forgotten in the strange lands the Velothi passed through. With the land still ruled by enemies, these wardens of the dead broke from Veloth's company upon arriving in Resdayn to seek out a place to safely inter their honored fallen.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nEventually they discovered a high plateau surrounded on all sides by rivers, a natural fortress which no enemy could approach unseen; Narsara's followers dug deep into the red spire to create the first Ancestral Vaults. To further safeguard the tombs, Narsara constructed a steading bearing her name to watch over it. Her husband became the first keeper of the tomb and her heirs were entrusted with continuing that duty.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nToday, the descendants of Narsara Hla-Alu's firstborn son, Andrus Hlaalu, reside in their manor in the Old Quarter of Narsis, the oldest continuously inhabited building in the city. Their patriarch is Tereldyn Hlaalu. They keep to their sacred duty of maintaining the city's vast catacombs, and remain detached from day-to-day politics.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSecond Family<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Second Family was formed by Tharel Hlaalu, the son of Narsara Hla-Alu's second born son. Tharel was more enterprising than his predecessors and is regarded as the first High Hlaalu to emerge. He built up the city of Narsis, constructing a large manor for his family atop the plateau, and formally vassalized the families outside of Narsara's Clan who had followed them: Clans Dren, Hleryn, Raran, and Vedas.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn the Age of the Warring Houses, the Second Family had assassinated the leaders of the Third Family and so remained the undisputed rulers of Narsis until the Red Khans sacked the city. Nerevar liberated Narsis, and after House Hlaalu swore vassalage to Nerevar, the Second Family resumed their position of leadership.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDuring the time of the Armistice, High Hlaalu Pasoroth was an important figure in the shaping of modern Morrowind. A famous arena champion in his day and General under Tiber Septim, he led Hlaalu's northern annexations and was instrumental in dictating terms in the new Council. However, Pasaroth notably stagnated when the District lines were drawn and the regency ended. Being a warleader, he was unsuited to peacetime governance and lacked the business acumen of his peers. He was ultimately assassinated by the Morag Tong.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn the present day, the patriarch of the Second Family is High Hlaalu Athires. Born at the turn of the era, the son of Pasoroth has successfully advanced the interests of the Great House Hlaalu during the Third Era. However, with the rise of Kragenmoor, the Simulacrum, and the opening of Vvardenfell, the Second Family is starting to show signs that their power is waning. Still, they remain the most powerful of the Seven Families, commanding the respect of the nobility and leading the Hlaalu Council.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThird Family<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe history of the Third Family is unknown. During the Age of the Warring Houses, the Second Family assassinated the leaders of the Third and drove out their followers, and their lore was lost. Today, those who would claim descent from this family are few and far between.<BR>",
