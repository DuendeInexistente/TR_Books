REMAN I or THE CYRODIIL<BR>\r\n\r\nAfter the War of Righteousness, the Alessian throne was crouched in the tattered remnants of misrule. Colovia and Nibenay were without true rulers, carved into city-states and negligible kingdoms, and ruled by corrupt local magnates. Save a few unlucky fools, none came forth to claim the title of Emperor, and for four hundred years the White-Gold Throne gathered dust in the shadowed halls of the Emperor's palace.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nSo it would have continued, were it not for the rise of Reman Cyrodiil. Born on the sacred heights of Sancre Tor, he was the child of King Hrol of the upper provinces and the maiden Shoni-Et, a distant relative of the true Alessian line. By the age of thirteen, Reman I had united the Colovian kingdoms through his piety, leadership and sacrosanct example. By joining his army with the Battlemage forces of the Nibenay he defeated the dreaded Tsaeci horde at Pale Pass, and elicited from that serpent people the promise of eternal servitude to the Emperors of Cyrodiil. Reman thus reunited Colovia and Nibenay under his rule, and entered the Imperial City as a conqueror and peacemaker.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nInspired by the loyalty and strength that manifested in his people united, Reman felt called to the holy purpose of uniting all of Tamriel under his Divine rule. His hand forced by the growing aggression of Alinor, Reman united the mannish races of Tamriel and waged a war as had until then never been seen on Nirn, conquering all of the north, the southern lands of Anequina, Pelletine, and Camoria, and much of Argonia. He secured heavy tribute from the kingdom of Alinor in return for accommodation. Only the dusky people of Morrowind resisted this rule, an act of willful sedition for which they were to suffer greatly in times to come.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nReman I was among the most wise and just rulers Cyrodiil ever knew, bringing peace and Imperial Law to the ignorant provinces, instigating great works of infrastructure and fortifications, and reuniting the Imperial people in their common cause and culture. On his deathbed he was thus called upon by the Divines to serve as a guiding star and example to man, and ever since he has been worshiped as the Worldly God, who did come to the aid of man in their hour of need, and returned to them the fires of purpose and identity.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nIX. BRAZOLLUS DOR<BR>\r\n\r\nWhile the name and deeds of Emperor Brazollus Dor are sure to ring out in beauty in the hallowed halls of Aetherius, his time of life was clearly overshadowed by the reign of his vaunted predecessor, Reman I. As such, we know precious little of Brazollus Dor, though it can be deduced that he continued the good works of his father, namely the building of Empire, through the construction of Remanite highways, bridges, and fortresses. Brazollus Dor was crowned in 1E 2762, and assumed his name in recognition of Emperor Belharza, also the second ruler in a line, whom Brazollus sought to emulate in all aspects. As such, Brazollus rejuvenated the cult of Morihaus in the Imperial City and instated many rituals in honor of that deity. From the forges of the Zenitharites he ordered a crown of golden bull-horns made, signifying the resurgence of Cyrodiil's Divine bloodline.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nBrazollus Dor's date of death goes unrecorded. Let this be a warning to the scribe and the record-keeper, that they must be truthful and exacting in their work, so that further generations may come to know of the great works of their betters.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nX. KASTAV or THE WARDEN<BR>\r\n\r\nThrough the byways of myth we are told the story of Emperor Brazollus Dor's succession. Upon his deathbed, Brazollus surveyed his progeny and found them a bitter disappointment: his many sons and daughters were to the last one drunks, halfwits, cowards and traitors. The Emperor thus denounced and disinherited them all, save for his latest grandson who had been born but three days before. Brazollus then called to his side his trusted advisor and close friend, Kastav of the Crossing Vale, and adopted him as his son and heir, tasked to keep the Empire safe until a son of the line of the Remanites came of age. And Brazollus instructed Kastav to lock away each and every one of his negligent sons and daughters in the holds of the Imperial Prison, so that they could never plot and conspire to overthrow him. By virtue of his adoption into the true line Emperor Kastav is counted among the true Emperors, and for his policy of detaining and imprisoning all his unworthy rivals he is to be known as Kastav the Warden.<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nLike Brazollus Dor, Emperor Kastav felt the negligence of the scribe's hand. Kastav was known to quell unrests in the lands of Skyrim, that eminent province whose people were normally first to join and advance the cause of the Empire, but under his rule did quarrel and chafe. Kastav had no patience for such reticence, and engineered the downfall of these upstart rebels, intending to entrench the Empire far into the north, so that its righteous rule would never again be doubted by the people of that land. Sadly, Kastav died before he could see his plans come to fruition, and it fell to his successor to lay the keystone on his great political work.<BR>\r\n\r\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":80,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
