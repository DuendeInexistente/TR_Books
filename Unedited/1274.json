Situated far north in the Sea of Ghosts, the island provides a welcome change from Morrowind's otherwise brown and dusty environments, with beautiful shorelines, green trees, glistening snow and fresh air. The settlement itself, a booming little town called Raven Rock, is a wellspring of opportunity just waiting for people to take advantage of. Whether it is driving ebony out of the ground, building sturdy homes from plentiful lumber, or simply serving the local brews at the bar, work there is rewarding and well-paid. Truly a place to call home. If you are interested in helping the EEC bring their venture to fruition, apply at the Resettlement Office today!<br><br>",
