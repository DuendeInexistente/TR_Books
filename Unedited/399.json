The collective of knights were in a fierce discussion over what should be done, and what actions should be taken. Sheor's disease had spread amongst the divinity, and Oriel had fallen ill. The knights were divided on what was the right course of action to take.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOne side of the table pressed not to interfere, to separate the star-court from the mortal world was the right and safest decision.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnother saw it only as right and just to cure Oriel's disease before it overtook him, or purge him if it was too late, before the world crumbled. For all starknights together might be able to subdue him.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nMeredie, the most luminant of the starknights was the most captivating of all, but inwardly she had greater doubts than them all. Her conscience asked for security, but her temper and zeal asked for action. Meredie uttered her favor for ridding the divine of the disease, and all other voices were silenced. The knights solemnly agreed, because who could disagree with her in Magnon's light?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnd so they followed her will-of-purpose, and went to the world of mortals.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhen Meredie and the knights arrived, the situation was more dire than expected. The disease affected both mortals and divine alike. They found themselves swarmed and surrounded by those who had fallen victim, the ravenous diseased.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe starknights pushed on behind Meredie's banner, cleaving the disease out of mortal flesh with Magnon's light. But the more Meredie purged them, the more her doubts deepened and entrenched. Meredie willed that the disease had to be eradicated from all, mortal and divine. And as such, she had made her oath in the heat of battle. And so they carved, carved, and carved still, and used the Eastern Star-King's light to form a path. But all around her she saw disease, and all around her she saw death, as her knights slowly fell.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Was this not Magnon's purpose, was this not her plight?\"<BR>\\r\\nHer light had faded, her will was drained; but a pale imitation remained. Her light became but a small ember, only a weak reflection of Magnon's light.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnd Meredie's retinue noticed,<BR>\\r\\nand so their will-of-purpose shattered,<BR>\\r\\nand so they fled to the star-court.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nShe wanted naught but flee, but an oath she had made. Magnon shan't accept her, and without her compatriots, she shall perish.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnd so Meredie left the battlefield. She left for a place outside the star-court and the mortal space, carving her refuge out of Magnon's stolen light.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThere she remains, to lend her aid to those who wish to see her oath fulfilled, to win back Magnon's grace, and return to the star-court glorious.<BR>",
