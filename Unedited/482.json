Sometimes, people find them hard to deal with. That's where the Temple and your faith come in. Through devotion, prayer, and this book, you will learn how to become a better mer.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo put your inner strength to work battling against your trials, there are three simple but powerful steps you must follow.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe First Step: Perform an act of virtue. What act in particular does not have any bearing- there are many virtuous acts that one might do: make a pilgrimage, help the impoverished, convert a non-believer to the religion of our Temple, take a vow of silence or fast for some days, or make a particularly kind donation to the Temple. You might ask a priest for a suggestion.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Second Step: Now, when you complete that act, remember the feeling that comes to you. For different people, it may vary: a sense of achievement, a sense of happiness, a sense of relief, even. It will be a good feeling, the good feeling that all people receive upon doing a good deed. Commit it to memory well.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Third Step: When next you encounter difficulty or hardship, face it head on and do this: Recall the feeling attained by performing the good act. Fix it firmly in your mind, and use it as your motivation. This is the strongest motivation possible: The divine motivation of higher achievement. When you are touched by this, your inner strength shines brightest, and will rise up to deal with your problems immediately. You may not recognise yourself when you do so, such is the transforming power of faith.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIf you wish to better yourself further, you may consider studying the paths of various saints, depending on the aspect of yourself you wish to improve. The book \"Lives of The Saints\" contains a short description of some figures that were canonised for their piety and unwavering faith. You may be able to find books that chronicle the life of specific saints in more detail in some bookstores, or possibly the library of your local temple. Read some of the sacred writings of Vivec, or arrange to be at your temple's next sermon-reading- they can enlighten the mind and touch the soul.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIf you, like many people, take comfort in prayer, I have compiled here some prayers, specially-written to give strength to you to combat your troubles. Use these in conjunction with the Third Step and you will be able to dismiss the hardest challenges.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAffirmative Prayer for Strength against Negativity of Self and Others<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNegativity destroys hope<BR>\\r\\nHope shall be the beacon by which I navigate throughout my life<BR>\\r\\nI shall not pay heed to the hopelessness of negativity<BR>\\r\\n\"No\" will not be taken for an answer<BR>\\r\\nPerseverance shall be my pillar of support, and I shall rise up and defeat denial<BR>\\r\\nLest my mind is weakened by my constant refusal<BR>\\r\\nAlmsivi.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPrayer of Perfection and Guiding Beauty<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBeauty shall bring me to my fullness<BR>\\r\\nFor I shall take the beauty unto myself and model myself after it<BR>\\r\\nEver striving at the ideal set by my betters<BR>\\r\\nSo that I might become strong and perfect<BR>\\r\\nAs shall hideousness too move me to perfection<BR>\\r\\nBy providing the power of repulsion<BR>\\r\\nAlmsivi.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPrayer of Shining Light<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe holy light of confidence shall surround me<BR>\\r\\nAnd mark me as one of strong will<BR>\\r\\nBlinding those who would seek to mislay me<BR>\\r\\nAnd illuminating me to those who recognise my strength<BR>\\r\\nSo that I need not speak for my words to be known as truthful<BR>\\r\\nAnd that I need not act for my actions to be known as righteous<BR>\\r\\nAlmsivi.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPrayer of Unmoving Resistance<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nA rock supports me at either side<BR>\\r\\nSo that I shall not falter or be shaken<BR>\\r\\nThough I am caressed with words sweet as honey<BR>\\r\\nAnd buffeted with threats as sharp as knives<BR>\\r\\nMy stubbornness shall be undying and infinite<BR>\\r\\nUntil I succeed in winning my way<BR>\\r\\nAlmsivi.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNotes: Again, you might wish to work some of these into your daily prayers. You can ask the priests at your local temple for help on how to do this. And now, you can go out into the world and use what I have taught you in this book. Almsivi, my friends, and remember that every day is a divine miracle!<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n(Publisher's Note: Dramar Thelon lives in ____ with his wife Marana.
