But this time as the light of the moon shone down upon him, he felt a prickling sensation start to overcome him. He convulsed in pain as he long claws burst out from under his fingernails. He felt the indescribable agony of his bones warping and taking on a new shape. His stringy and frail muscles swelled and he felt new strength in his limbs. He looked at his hands and saw that his wrinkled hands had been replaced by the terrible hairy claws of a monster.
