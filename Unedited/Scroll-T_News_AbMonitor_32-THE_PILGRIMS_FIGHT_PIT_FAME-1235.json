Emerging from complete obscurity only recently, the Pilgrim has convincingly dispatched a succession of challengers, including the crowd favorites Harge the Large, the Corsairs, and Takhur the Terrible. To the delight of the crowd, the Pilgrim ended their historic run in the season's championship bout against the previous champion, the Nightingale, a contest which saw over nine million septims wagered.<BR><BR>\\r\\nWhile it is unclear what the future holds for this popular new fighter in coming seasons, the Pilgrim's unprecedented ascent to the very pinnacle of the sport has already earned them a place in pit fighting history for a generation.<BR>",
