This is a recording of that event.]<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nFIRST BLOOD. Master of Horns, Ulmethys Dun-Ammu, claims to have drawn first blood on the field and presents fourty-seven heads. The most important of these are identified as Varmir, reeve of Askareth; Holvilde Elf-Hammer, housecarl of the jarl of Dunkreath; and Brynvard Black-Teeth, captain of Hjolfrstad. He is given a flock of dozen trained Hoom beasts and his name is recorded in this book. In total the retinue led by Serjo Dun-Ammu took one hundred enemy heads. Each warrior is given a gold ring from the Hortator's finger.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nSECOND BLOOD. A young spearman from Serjo Venim's retinue claims second blood and presents four heads. One of the heads is identified as Vraggolaf of Dunkreath, a young prince of the Nord king's line. The young spearman is gifted with a silver neck chain from the Hortator's neck. The tip of her spear is dipped in precious resin and a red ribbon is tied to its shaft. Serjo Venim declares that she is now adopted as her sword-daughter. Her name, Meteresu Venim, is recorded here. In total the retinue of Serjo Venim took seventy-eight heads. Each warrior is given a tract of land south of Roryn.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nOTHER RECORDED HEADS.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nSerjo Selmuth Morvayn presents twenty-two heads. In total her retinue took sixty-three enemy heads. Each warrior is given a resin amulet.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nSerjo Hlevaaru Llethri and Serjo Ores Arobar present their heads jointly, sixteen heads each. They have a dispute over the head of Ulvmurd Half-Boar, thane of Ystralond, which they both claim to have cut off his shoulders. Since the war is now over the Hortator graciously allows them to settle their dispute in a duel, which is to take place during the victory feast. In total the retinues of House Llethri and House Arobar took one hundred and sixteen heads. [Scribe's Note: Later that night Serjo Llethri won the duel for the Nord's head, which she then gave to widow Arobar as a token of respect for the late Serjo Arobar.]<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nSera Rother Madras presents eleven heads. He is made Captain of Verarchen and a ceremonial blade is entrusted with his House and his name is recorded here.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nSera Talna Ramoran presents three heads. A vengeful ghost takes the hold of one of these heads. Its white eyes open and the ghost moves its mouth: \"Hear the words of Nojtur Long-Hair, vile skinchangers of the East! The hand that cut me down shall perish before the dawn! A thousand winters upon you!\" Archers guarding the Hortator shoot the head, but the dead Nord's curse remains. Talna Ramoran is escorted out of the war tent with no gifts, but her name is recorded here. [Scribe's Note: The next morning she was found frozen to death outside the camp.]<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nRiders of Houses Salothren and Sarethi return late to present eighty heads of routed enemies, made up of Nordic servants and camp followers. Though great in number these heads are of a lesser importance. The riders are given extra measures of mazte and flin for the feast to come.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nIn total four-hundred and seventy-one enemy heads were presented and recorded. Heads of the most high-ranking enemies are buried with proper rituals under a heavy slab of stone. Their names are carved on the underside of the stone so should any of their spirit become restless they can read their own name to convince them they are indeed dead. The rest of the heads are treated with resin and placed on pikes around the war camp's perimeter. One hundred and fourty-six candles are lit for each fallen Redoran warrior.<BR><BR>","data":{"weight":4.0,"value":100,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
