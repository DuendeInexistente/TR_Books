While they can be violent and vicious, they are profoundly dedicated to one another in battle. They have proven themselves to be the best keepers of Tiber Septim's glory, and the glory of his descendants. I reinforce this in my design for their training. They are set aside for a time from their ordinary routines. I give them special sharings which they can look back upon with pleasure for the rest of their lives. They come of age in the company of their brothers in preparation for events more profound. What you share in companionship always prepares you for greater things. The haze of nostalgia covers their days among their brothers, making those days into something different than they were. That's the way today changes their history. All contemporaries do not inhabit the same time. The past is always changing, but few realize it . . .\"<BR><BR>\r\n\" . . . Make no heroes. A hero inevitably results in the breaking of comradery. The group becomes dependent upon that hero as though he were a father and they were his children. The ability of the group to function as it was meant to function ceases, and the system breaks apart. So long as the soldiers are set on equal footing, they are a perfectly synched fighting group. The system of hierarchy is a system that breeds weakness into otherwise strong and competent warriors . . .\"<BR><BR>\r\n\" . . . The relationship between soldier and commander is analogous to the relationship between serf and lord, apprentice and master, and even worshipper and god. Each association requires absolute subordination on the part of the lesser member in order for the system to continue appropriately. The serf must obey his lord, the apprentice his master, and the worshipper his god. Thus it is with the soldier. The greater member must use a judicious blend of punishment and reward. If the master applies excessive punishment, the servant will become docile and weak, incapable of bravery or initiative. However, if the master does not grant rewards shrewdly, the servant loses respect for the master and becomes difficult to control. Thus, the relationship between soldier and commander must be a balance . . .\"<BR><BR>\r\n\" . . . Most civilization is based on cowardice. It's so easy to civilize by teaching cowardice. You water down the standards which would lead to bravery. You restrain the will. You regulate the appetites. You fence in the horizons. You make a law for every movement. You deny the existence of the dynamic. You teach even the children to breathe slowly. You tame . . .\"<BR><BR>\r\n  - Lucio Argelus, Imperial Commander<BR><BR>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"440000\">\r\nTraveler<FONT COLOR=\"000000\"><BR><BR>\r\nI walked through the desert<BR>\r\nalone.<BR>\r\nThe unceasing sun<BR>\r\nas a slaver's lash upon my back.<BR>\r\nMy skin was burned,<BR>\r\nmy water spent.<BR>\r\nI would die as a silhouette,<BR>\r\ndark skin on white sands.<BR><BR>\r\nThen I was found,<BR>\r\nalone no more.<BR>\r\nShe gave me water,<BR>\r\nshe gave me food,<BR>\r\nshe gave me life.<BR>\r\nWe were entwined by blood<BR>\r\nand we live forever.<BR><BR>\r\n  - Taken from the Oral Histories of Hammerfell<BR>","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":40,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
