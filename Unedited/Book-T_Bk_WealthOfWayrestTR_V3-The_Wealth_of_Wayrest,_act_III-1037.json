We follow a path<BR>\\r\\nToo often traveled. See the footsteps<BR>\\r\\nLeft from the last travel of Rain's Hand.<BR>\\r\\nKelt: Ah, too long it has been,<BR>\\r\\nThe treacherous Bretons have<BR>\\r\\nLied too many times for my axe<BR>\\r\\nTo lay still. Their blood shall<BR>\\r\\nNever reach our lands, it will<BR>\\r\\nRun back to their decadent halls.<BR>\\r\\nWulf: Gather the men, we follow<BR>\\r\\nThe ice, and descend to Wrothgar.<BR>\\r\\n(exit attendants and Keltis)<BR><BR>\\r\\nWulf: I feel the urge you force in me.<BR>\\r\\nYsmir your will still in this realm<BR>\\r\\nWill bring a glorious rebirth of<BR>\\r\\nOur ancient line. You wiped<BR>\\r\\nThe curse from our books,<BR>\\r\\nYou quenched the fires of<BR>\\r\\nRebellion, and for your<BR>\\r\\nNobility you received the dagger<BR>\\r\\nThat fell from the elves of Wayrest<BR>\\r\\nFrom the table of peace.<BR>\\r\\nSo I am, the descendant of<BR>\\r\\nThe new pantheon.<BR>\\r\\n(exit Wulfharth)<BR><BR>\\r\\n(Enter two soldiers)<BR>\\r\\nSol 1: Do you smell what the west carries?<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: Ah, and I hate its roaming tongue.<BR>\\r\\nSol 1: We shall meet at the walls,<BR>\\r\\nWhere we shall begin our<BR>\\r\\nReclamation of the lowlands.<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: My ancestors held a land in<BR>\\r\\nWrothgar, in the days before<BR>\\r\\nThe Empire.<BR>\\r\\nSol 1: I've been to my ancestors' hold,<BR>\\r\\nStrong it was, built upon an ebony<BR>\\r\\nFoundation, rich as well.<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: An ebony foundation?<BR>\\r\\nSol 1: Ah, they would have mined it,<BR>\\r\\nBut it would be a waste of the<BR>\\r\\nBeautiful countryside.<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: Ebony foundation, I've never<BR>\\r\\nHeard of such a thing.<BR>\\r\\nSol 1: It is true, a grand manor<BR>\\r\\nWithin its halls. All the<BR>\\r\\nSpoils of the harvest, and<BR>\\r\\nMeat, delicious meats from<BR>\\r\\nAll of Tamriel were delivered daily.<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: Well where is this grand hall<BR>\\r\\nOf emperors.<BR>\\r\\nSol1: Why do you care?<BR>\\r\\nYou wouldn't be allowed in<BR>\\r\\nThe way you look. No one<BR>\\r\\nSpeaks of it anymore, the<BR>\\r\\nBretons grew tired of failed<BR>\\r\\nInvasions, so it was left untouched<BR>\\r\\nIn the middle of High Rock.<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: Well we shall see it when we<BR>\\r\\nMarch to Wayrest then, and<BR>\\r\\nYour kin will give us stay.<BR>\\r\\nSol 1: They would, had it not been<BR>\\r\\nFor the fire of last summer,<BR>\\r\\nSuch a waste. Barely recognizable<BR>\\r\\nNow from the mountain side,<BR>\\r\\nToo hard to find now.<BR>\\r\\nSol 2: Oh such a shame, I would have<BR>\\r\\nLiked to try a feast from Hammerfell.<BR>\\r\\nAnd all that ebony, I could be<BR>\\r\\nRicher than all the line of Septim.<BR><BR>\\r\\n(Keltis falls back to the two soldiers)<BR><BR>\\r\\nKelt: There is no ebony in Wrothgar.<BR>\\r\\nNow shut your ramblings.<BR>\\r\\n(exit Keltis to the front lines)<BR><BR>\\r\\nSol 1: It was a unique deposit.<BR>\\r\\n(exit all)<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\nScene II<BR>\\r\\nIn Wayrest, the army of Camoran led by Tarinketh meets with Eadwyre to plan the march into Skyrim.<BR><BR>\\r\\n(Enter Tarinketh and soldiers into the hall of Wayrest)<BR>\\r\\nEad: (to Merithyn) He brings his men into my hall,<BR>\\r\\nSuch insolence these forked-tongues<BR>\\r\\nHave never shown, hold yourself.<BR>\\r\\n(to all) Welcome Tarinketh, the<BR>\\r\\nSecond new moon expect you, the half<BR>\\r\\nCrescent greets you tonight.<BR>\\r\\nTar: Your waters are cold and your<BR>\\r\\nWinds still as a cavern's depths,<BR>\\r\\nInsult my men no more with<BR>\\r\\nThe schedules of short-sighted men.<BR>\\r\\nMar: A grand hall you stand in Tarinketh,<BR>\\r\\nNot made of the glorious mud you praise.<BR>\\r\\nEad: Ease good men, we are all allies<BR>\\r\\nOf the bay, let no unrest of days<BR>\\r\\nDetached pull us under the surface.<BR>\\r\\nTar: Calm men.<BR>\\r\\nEad: In your absence the Western<BR>\\r\\nForces have entered the Wrothgar highlands.<BR>\\r\\nThe horde is close to the walls they say.<BR>\\r\\nMar: We must leave tonight, or the land<BR>\\r\\nShall push them upon us.<BR>\\r\\nTar: Then by this crescent we shall<BR>\\r\\nMove tonight, fire and dust<BR>\\r\\nBurn the eyes of the Nords.<BR>\\r\\n(exit all)<BR><BR><BR>\\r\\nScene III<BR>\\r\\nIn the Wrothgar Highlands the army of Daggerfall led by Fatian camps in by a glacial melt stream.<BR><BR>\\r\\nFat: See these cliffs alive now Benowyn?<BR>\\r\\nBen: Ay, thankfully Akatosh does not <BR>\\r\\nSend us into the fangs of winter,<BR>\\r\\nLike the ill-fated son, Gothyrd.<BR>\\r\\nFat: In the new moist ground you can see<BR>\\r\\nThe path of a wandering mountain bear,<BR>\\r\\nWho stayed at this tree, for it's<BR>\\r\\nSweet reward, and caught a slaughterfish<BR>\\r\\nIn the fast receding ice.
