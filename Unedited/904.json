This collection has been curated by the Imperial University's Committee for the Transposition of Indigenous Oral Traditions, and serves to keep alive in the minds of both academics and the general public the roots of our culture and shared history.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn this companion to the Talhjolde, different scholars will offer their learned understanding of each tale's origins, meaning and significance. It is important to remember, of course, that these are neither the original Nordic tales nor a serviceable representation of Atmoran totemic religion; they do, however, serve to illustrate the ways in which our mannish origins retain their significance in Tamrielic culture to this day.<BR><BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">I. Hvals Bol (Whale's Sorrow)<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\">- Hakan at-Hatan, Folkloric Linguistics<BR><BR>\\r\\nThere are some odd anachronisms in the language used in this piece. For example, the \"fighting twins of old\" indubitably refer to the Shield-Thanes of Shor, Tsun and the lesser-known Stuhn (regarded as having left the Nordic pantheon to become Stendarr). However, the Whale in question is the totem of Stuhn, and so there is a strange paradox in likening Whale's emotions to his future representation. This is of course entirely typical of Nordic storytelling, but should highlight to the reader the limitations of applying these modern translations to Mythic Era Atmora.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">II. Allfathirs Beit (Allfather's Riddle)<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\">- Elvyra Aumilie, Indigenous Oral Traditions<BR><BR>\\r\\nRiddle-contests and feats of cleverness are very popular in the Nordic oral tradition, and this is exemplary of the genre. Although the character of the \"Allfather\" or \"All-Maker\" has either departed mainland Nordic storytelling or been folded into the character of Shor, here we see them as distinct and conflicting characters. In particular, the Fox (Shor's totem) is rebuked for his cleverness at the end, when this kind of wily glory-seeking is most commonly depicted as unambiguous heroism.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">III. Modiskva Bern (The Angry Bear)<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\">- Batul gra-Brok, Metaphysical History<BR><BR>\\r\\nThe presence of an Adversary in this story has interesting metaphysical implications. I am unaware of many Nordic traditions that have retained this character, barring the most malicious interpretations of Alduin, and it is a concept that challenges traditionally-understood Nordic metaphysics. In particular, it proposes a firm end for Nirn, one that contradicts the kalpic cycle and the existence of a Sovngarde-like reality outside of Mundus.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">IV. Horsk Olf (Wise Wolf)<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\">- Johannes Silvanus, Indigenous Oral Traditions<BR><BR>\\r\\nThis really is an excellent example of Atmoran and early Nordic songwriting, and it is very exciting to be able to include it in this collection. A few adjustments have been made to ensure rhymes and a consistent meter, but otherwise the spirit of the original song has been captured. The Frost Maiden is one of many archetypes from Atmoran poetry, like Lord Winter or Lady Harvest, whose role has been supplanted by individual heroes of later Nordic storytelling -- not a great loss to some, but I personally miss the timeless quality of these characters.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">V. Aliga Beit (The Same Question)<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\">- Basil al-Taneth, Tamrielic Migration Studies<BR><BR>\\r\\nThe title here is a play on words that translates well -- it is the \"same question\" in that it is a question of \"sameness\", rather than a repetition of some unspoken but pre-existing enquiry. The moral of the tale -- that familiarity is forged and not inherently imbued -- has particular significance for the late Atmoran period, when shifts in climate were forcing disparate Nordic peoples into uneasy coexistence. One should not, however, mistake the answer to this \"same question\" to be one that Nordic thought has applied freely to the races of Tamriel, as the bloody history of conquest and subjugation post-Atmora demonstrates.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"500F0F\">VI. Ovaldung Orm (The Snake of Chaos)<BR>\\r\\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\">- Dagny of the Tower, Skaldic Studies<BR><BR>\\r\\nEven southerners will generally be familiar with the outline of this story, as it has entered popular mythology and spread through Legion postings and court appointments. It's not known when Orcs were introduced as the victims of Fox's clever thinking, and there is surprisingly little record of conflict between Orcs and early Tamrielic Nords until the Battle of Dragon Wall in 1E660, but it seems likely to have been introduced by skalds from south-eastern Skyrim who had chafed against the predations of Velothi Mountain Orcs in the First Era.<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":40,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
