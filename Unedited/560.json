In truth, this version of Sload soap is alchemically less valuable than the \"true\" product, due to its degenerate origins and the Nibenese focus on cosmetics over alchemical usage. Trade with the Sload has been illegal across the Empire since the First Era, and any samples to be found in alchemists' or perfumers' workshops today are more than likely acquired through illegal means. Not so in the Nibenay, where purified, low-grade oil forms the basis of a thriving market in salves and lotions, all guaranteed to keep the skin young, increase agility and virility, and cloud the mind to the best of Niben ability.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nOne would be forgiven, however, for abstaining from these products after learning the way in which they are produced. The Niben soap industry, being denied the natural source for its soap, now relies on a limited number of Sload grubs, alchemically suspended in an embryonic, non-sentient state, all of which were plundered ages ago during the Thrassian War. In the great soap-tanks of Lake Rumare and the Niben Bay, these grubs are fed on masses of rotting fish and crab dredged from the river, until they grow to gargantuan proportions. When a grub has reached a sufficiently massive size, the so-called soap-cutters come to lop large pieces off the creature, leaving the kernel mass to regrow, and process the cut pieces into the oil so beloved by merchants and priests.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this way, the Niben refineries have made a profit from the same regenerating grubs for centuries. Soap refineries of this type can be found in Bravil, Delodiil and on the Imperial City's poorer, more industrial islands. Since each refinery only uses its own specimens, a piece of soap can often reliably be traced back to its firm of origin due to the signature features each grub imparts on its product.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThese unique features also serve as a means of trade protection. The limited resources and esoteric trade secrets of the soap-cutters make this profitable industry very entrenched and resistant to growth. It is in practice impossible to start a new firm in a legal manner, since obtaining a grub requires one to either deal with the Sload (which is illegal), buy from the refineries (who never sell), or steal from them (whereafter the product would be instantly recognized). The existing refineries live in constant fear of  sabotage: an expertly used bag of salt could very well decimate an entire grub population. Indeed, recent aggressive business practices have all but destroyed the Bravil firms, putting further strain on a limited market. These unpleasant business practices, coupled with the occasional rumor of escaped feral Sload in the Imperial City's underground, have given the refineries an unpleasant reputation as of late.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":40,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
