In a shocking admission, Akaterina Hadrach confessed to being unable to pay off a myriad of debts or retain her household staff. Pressed further, Hadrach admitted that in her current financial straits, with only a Navy pension as income, she will be unable to contest the next royal election or make the customary donative to the Red Treasury.<BR><BR>\\r\\nThe Hadrach family, one of Anvil's oldest and most prestigious, fell into disfavor with the Queen after the failed coup attempt of 423.
