It is he who shall punish any, sorcerer or spirit, who should reach above their rightful station or dishonor covenant in actions or thought.

He appears as a blood-thirsty bear or wolf or stag or an antlered wildman of the woods. He has little interest in city-folk and can be summoned only by those living beyond the reach of civilization. His subjects are frenzied and without knowledge of any symbolic language. They are liable to escape the bounds of magic circles in their ignorance, but can be contained with open flame. He can bestow upon the conjurer the spirit of the beast, the fear of silver and the instinct to hunt.<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_mehrunes.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nThe Prince MEHRUNES or DAGON or MERRUDAG or MERDAGES or MAGNADAGUS is the Marshal of Misrule. He appears as a gargantuan golem carrying the sun's fire on his shoulders and legions of spearmen, swordsmen, and archers in each of his many hands. His are the catastrophic forces of nature. He is a rebellious Prince fond of violence whose favor the sorcerer may try to gain by performing the summoning rite in the midst of a battle or a disaster. He can bring about the violent demise of multitudes of enemies, but will not see the difference between friends and foes. The conjurer should be careful not to be eradicated by the Prince themselves. <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_imago.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nIMAGO STORM is a General of Misrule, who appears in the form of a fearsome horned knight. It is within his power to teach strategic and tactical wisdom. He may be convinced into lending the support of his legions, but only if he feels confident that they would be well used. If his legions are poorly lead, he will command them to turn against their commanders. <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_namira.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nThe Prince NAMIRA or NIMIRA or NIMARR or NAMIN is the duchess of the fringes of the void and appears as a beggar crawling with vermin. Before summoning the Prince, the sorcerer should first fast for three days and then swallow a salt stone to ward against her revolting presence. She can create disgust among men and can make enemies and rivals disliked and shunned. She collects and reveals secrets of unnatural or shameful nature.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_sanguine.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nThe Prince SANGUINE or SANGINIS or SAGUNAR is the duke of the fringes of the void and appears as a drunkard or a common devil or an unclothed man or woman. A conjurer may gain his favor by drinking to his good health before the summoning ritual. He teaches suaveness and can make mortals rich and well-liked. He can also make enemies appear foolish and self-destructive without them realizing it. \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<br>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":200,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
