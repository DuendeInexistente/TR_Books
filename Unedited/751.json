In writing them, he planted seeds for his successors to tend - seeds that would aid in cultivating the very garden of thought that we tend today. But when I contemplate the teachings of Saint Olms as of late, I find that I cannot help but be troubled by the assertions of those Temple scholars named Golsu Farelas and Ulmelyn Llaryn. Their writings have created an unspoken rift among their peers, and in doing so they have attracted the attention of the Ordination. It is clear that they mean well, and that they write in the spirit of understanding, but the arguments they make are in dire need of contextualization within the strictures of Determined Law. This is a book for both the layman and the scholar; it will give an explanation of the Laws Determined as well as the Laws Ordained, and seek to reconcile the worldviews of these two authors into one harmonious union.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHeresy is not itself a violation of the Laws Determined. That would be impossible, for what is determined by the Tribunal may not be undetermined. It is, however, a violation of the Laws Ordained, which have been established by word and deed in the mundial world, rather than celestial triune decree beyond it. These laws are enforced and protected by the blessed House Indoril, the sacred Ordination and the glorious Temple of our Tribunal. They are breakable, and it is the moral duty of every Velothi to preserve them. To do otherwise, then, would be the simplest definition of heresy.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nUltimately, nothing is truly beyond the will of the Tribunal. Everything which occurs, whether it is in the mundial world or beyond, follows the principles of the Laws Determined. The Laws Ordained, and the heresies that test them, both fall within the scope of this all-encompassing metajurisdiction. There is no extant form of heresy that may threaten the Laws Determined because, as has been established, what has been determined by the Tribunal may not be undetermined.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnd why should they? ALMSIVI sees farther than mortals and spirits both - they gaze across the span of eternity, reading and applying it in their way. There is no room for mistakes, no need for changes, when one sees in such a state as they. Would it then be fair to say that heresy is important? Certainly, for if it were not then the Tribunal would not have created the circumstances by which it exists. Would it then be fair to say that heresy is evil? Certainly, for if it were not then it would not be in violation of the Laws Ordained.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOne may contemplate or argue as to why this is the case, attempting to understand the will of the Three to the best of their ability, but to do so is of secondary importance. Of primary importance is reconciling these two realities within the greater scheme of what has been determined for us, and moving forward with the understanding that they are both true. There will come a time when heresy no longer exists, when what is ordained reigns true across all the garden of Resdayn, and when that time comes the Velothi will be all the more grateful for the work that is done in the garden today.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSuch is the will of ALMSIVI, and such is the purview of House Indoril.<BR>",
