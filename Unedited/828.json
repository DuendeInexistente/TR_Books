Their temple administration formed the core of the early First Empire, and their words of wisdom inform the philosophies of the Great Faiths to this day.]<BR>\\r<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Ial spoke of a scribe who wrote with red letters in the community of Sard. One day, a man came to ask of him a copy of a scroll with many great words. The scribe, who was a wise man, copied the scroll, but omitted certain glyph-phrases. The man read the scroll, and noticed that some words were missing.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSo he returned and said to the scribe, 'Honored one, there are glyphs missing.' The scribe replied, 'Go, and read what is written, and learn of it what you can. When you understand it, come back and I will write the rest.' And this was in the spirit of JULIANOS.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Kitta said, 'No labor is as profound as to wander, for it is when we set our feet on the wild roads that lead through the heart of the jungle that the Dmath come to besiege us. It is then, that we are at our weakest. Therefore, let us build a city with high walls, and send out virtuous hermits to wage a war of words on the lonely roads.' And this was in the spirit of KYNARETH.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Sen spoke of an old man who lived in Cenar. If there was ever hard labor to do, he would set upon it with great joy, saying 'It is good to work today, for labor begets more labor, and labor is a great and enduring reward.' And this was in the spirit of ZENITHAR.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Dibba was asked by her disciples about temptation and its distractions. She replied, 'The only time when our minds are not occupied by temptation is when we indulge in it. Therefore, to give in to temptation is the only way to conquer it.' This is a great truth, for they who indulge in their desires are in fact not worried about them. And this was in the spirit of DIBELLA.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Taka spoke of a Hared warrior of the west lands, she was counted among the powerful by the people who live there. One day, a stranger approached her on the road and said: 'Plant your sword in this hill, and water it for fifteen years. Then bring the fruit to my servants.' The warrior did as she was told, and after fifteen years the sword brought forth a fruit of iron. The warrior brought this to the temple, and said to the priests: 'Eat this, the fruit of patience and obedience.' And this was in the spirit of AKATOSH.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Ara was asked about the correct path. She told of a holy man who lived among the Kothri, who baked bread for the people. The hermits came to him and accused him of weakness, asking why he did not practice asceticism, or vigils, or fasting, or the other methods of attaining purity of mind and soul. He said, 'No mind can be clean and no soul can be pure if it hungers, or if its fellows hunger. First, we must eat. Only then can they attain enlightenment.' And this was in the spirit of MARA.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Ten was moved to speak about the wicked and the evil. He said, 'The wicked are allowed to live, so that their vile and evil deeds may be observed by the judges. They will be put to the test, and judged, to be reformed either by law or by the sword. Keep law and the sword in your hand at all times.' And this was in the spirit of STENDARR.<BR>\\n<BR>\\nUn-Sar-Atha travelled along the river Niben going south. She encountered a skiffman, who offered her passage. The skiffman remarked on the fish that live in the great river, saying, 'When the waters are calm, it is easy to catch good fish for dinner, but when storm swells the river, we must go hungry.\" The wise woman replied, 'The work of the fisherman is bound by mortal failure. Regardless of circumstance, one is either obliged to catch all fish, or to catch none at all.' And this was in the spirit of ARKAY.<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":100,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
