  "text": "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\\r\\nBeggar<BR>\\r\\nby Reven<BR><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>Eslaf Erol was the last of the litter of five born to the Queen of the prosperous Nordic kingdom of Erolgard, Lahpyrcopa, and her \\r\\r\\nhusband, the King of Erolgard, Ytluaf. During pregnancy, the Queen had been more than twice as wide as she was tall, and the act of delivery took three \\r\\r\\nmonths and six days after it had begun. It is perhaps understandable that the Lahpyrcopa elected, upon expelling Eslaf to frown, say, 'Good riddance,' and \\r\\r\\ndie.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nLike many Nords, Ytluaf did not care very much for his wife and less for his children. His subjects were puzzled, therefore, when he announced that he would \\r\\r\\nfollow the ancient tradition of his people of Atmora of following his beloved spouse to the grave. They had not thought they were particularly in love, nor \\r\\r\\nwere they aware that such a tradition existed. Still, the simple people were grateful, for the little royal drama alleviated their boredom, which was and is \\r\\r\\na common problem in the more obscure parts of northern Skyrim, particularly in wintertide.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHe gathered his household staff and his five fat, bawling little heirs in front of him, and divided his estate. To his son Ynohp, he gave his title; to his \\r\\r\\nson Laernu, he gave his land; to his son Suoibud, he gave his fortune; to his daughter Laicifitra, he gave his army. Ytluaf's advisors had suggested he keep \\r\\r\\nthe inheritance together for the good of the kingdom, but Ytluaf did not particularly care for his advisors, or the kingdom, for that matter. Upon making his \\r\\r\\nannouncement, he drew his dagger across his throat.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOne of the nurses, who was rather shy, finally decided to speak as the King's life ebbed away. 'Your highness, you forgot your fifth child, little \\r\\r\\nEslaf.'<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nGood Ytluaf groaned. It is somewhat hard to concentrate with blood gushing from one's throat, after all. The King tried in vain to think of something to \\r\\r\\nbequeath, but there was nothing left.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nFinally he sputtered, irritably, 'Eslaf should have taken something then' and died.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThat a babe but a few days old was expected to demand his rightful inheritance was arguably unfair. But so Eslaf Erol was given his birthright with his \\r\\r\\nfather's dying breath. He would have nothing, but what he had taken.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSince no one else would have him, the shy nurse, whose name was Drusba, took the baby home. It was a decrepit little shack, and over the years that followed, \\r\\r\\nit became more and more decrepit. Unable to find work, Drusba sold all of her furnishings to buy food for little Eslaf. By the time he was old enough to walk \\r\\r\\nand talk, she had sold the walls and the roof as well, so they had nothing but a floor to call home. And if you've ever been to Skyrim, you can appreciate \\r\\r\\nthat that is scarcely sufficient.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDrusba did not tell Eslaf the story of his birth, or that his brothers and sister were leading quite nice lives with their inheritances, for, as we have \\r\\r\\nsaid, she was rather shy, and found it difficult to broach the subject. She was so painfully shy, in fact, that whenever he asked any questions about where \\r\\r\\nhe came from, Drusba would run away. That was more or less her answer to everything, to flee.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn order to communicate with her at all, Eslaf learned how to run almost as soon as he could walk. He couldn't keep up with his adopted mother at first, but \\r\\r\\nin time he learned to go toe-heel toe-heel if he anticipated a short but fast sprint, and heel-toe heel-toe if it seemed Drusba was headed for a long \\r\\r\\ndistance marathon flight. He never did get all the answers he needed from her, but Eslaf did learn how to run.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe kingdom of Erolgard had, in the years that Eslaf was growing, become quite a grim place. King Ynohp did not have a treasury, for Suoibud had been given \\r\\r\\nthat; he did not have any property for income, for Laernu had been given that; he did not have an army to protect the people, for Laicifitra had been given \\r\\r\\nthat. Futhermore, as he was but a child, all decisions in the kingdom went through Ynohp's rather corrupt council. It had become a bureaucratic exploitative \\r\\r\\nland of high taxes, rampant crime, and regular incursions from neighboring kingdoms. Not a particular unusual situation for a kingdom of Tamriel, but an \\r\\r\\nunpleasant one nonetheless.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe time finally came when the taxcollector arrived to Drusba's hovel, such as it was, to collect the only thing he could - the floor. Rather than protest, \\r\\r\\nthe poor shy maid ran away, and Eslaf never saw her again.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWithout a home or a mother, Eslaf did not know what to do. He had grown accustomed to the cold open air in Drusba's shack, but he was hungry.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n'May I have a piece of meat?' he asked the butcher down the street. 'I'm very hungry.'<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe man had known the boy for years, often spoke to his wife about how sorry he felt for him, growing up in a home with no ceilings or walls. He smiled at \\r\\r\\nEslaf and said, 'Go away, or I'll hit you.'<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nEslaf hurriedly left the butcher and went to a nearby tavern. The tavernkeeper had been a former valet in the king's court and knew that the boy was by right \\r\\r\\na prince. Many times, he had seen the poor ragged lad in the streets, and sighed at the way fate had treated him.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n'May I have something to eat?' Eslaf asked this tavernkeeper. 'I'm very hungry.'<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n'You're lucky I don't cook you up and eat you,' replied the tavernkeeper.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nEslaf hurriedly left the tavern. For the rest of the day, the boy approached the good citizens of Erolgard, begging for food. One person had thrown something \\r\\r\\nat him, but it turned out to be an inedible rock.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAs night fell, a raggedy man came up to Eslaf and, without saying a word, handed him a piece of fruit and a piece of dried meat. The lad took it, wide-eyed, \\r\\r\\nand as he devoured it, he thanked the man very sweetly.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n'If I see you begging on the streets tomorrow,' the man growled. 'I'll kill you myself. There are only so many beggars we of the guild allow in any one town, \\r\\r\\nand you make it one too many. You're ruining business.'<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIt was a good thing Eslaf Erol knew how to run. He ran all night.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book Thief.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n",
