A city and a temple in one, Almas Thirr stands in tribute to the crossing of the mighty river Thirr by the faithful of the Velothi Exodus, founders of the nation of Morrowind. At the crossroads of the two great arteries of eastern commerce, Veloth's Path and the Thirr River, Almas Thirr has become a nexus of wealth and trade, and the city has expanded several times during its history to accomodate both the traders and priests who flock there.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nRiver trade is more heavily regulated than road caravans. While caravans are permitted free passage through the city, ships large and small are stopped in the river lock for a cargo inspection. In order to avoid fines, confiscation of goods, or investigation by the Ordinators, travelers are advised to consult with Temple officials for the latest list of contraband before arriving in Almas Thirr by ship. Vessels intending to continue their journey upstream toward Narsis or downstream to Old Ebonheart must make a tribute to the Temple in the form of gold or trade goods.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPilgrims on Veloth's Path are advised to rest for several days in Almas Thirr before continuing their westward journey to Othrenis and Almalexia. The Hostel of the Crossing provides free lodging for pilgrims. Most pilgrims will be familiar with the Bloodstone Pilgrimage, which is customarily hosted by the Hetman (leader) of the city's Velothi residents. This grueling undertaking terminates at the Bloodstone Shrine deep within the Monastery of St. Veloth. Faithful visitors may also wish to attend the frequent sermons at the Temple complex within the canton, or pray at the various shrines around the city. Of special interest is the Shrine to St. Veloth on the eastern bank, which is believed to be the one of the oldest shrines to that illustrious saint in all Morrowind. For those seeking quiet meditation, the balconies on the upper level of the canton provide an excellent vantage from which to contemplate the Mother Thirr. Travelers should be aware, however, that Temple officials have the prerogative use of these areas and may ask the meditating traveler to move to a location on the lower level.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPilgrims seeking provisions for their onward journey need look no further than the canton, which contains all the services a pilgrim may need. For more worldly goods, visitors may visit Market Street on the city's west side, which hosts a plentitude of stalls and shops run by Velothi and outlanders alike. For those seeking protection on their journey, the Fighters Guild hosts warriors for hire, while the Mages Guild is home to some of the foremost enchanters in Morrowind. Travelers are advised to steer clear of the Docks district, as the constant transit of cargo and ongoing repair work to vessels in port may pose dangers to the incautious.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\\r\\nRegion Information\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAlmas Thirr sits at the heart of the bucolic Aanthirin region. Dotted with large plantations, small farms, and Velothi villages, and criss-crossed with good roads, the region around the Thirr River is very safe for even the most novice traveler. While not dangerous, hikers are advised to keep a safe distance from the graceful Velk which roam the region, as they are considered sacred to the Tribunal Temple and should not be disturbed. There are also a few ruins of old Indoril manors and even older strongholds of the ancient Chimer, both of which should be given a wide berth. Otherwise, the native fauna of Aanthirin should pose no threat to those who find themselves in the wilderness. Indeed, with welcoming settlements often a short journey away, there is little risk to a brisk hike into the country, and much reward in the region's idyllic vistas.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<IMG SRC=\"TR\\oldebonheart_region_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"377\" HEIGHT=\"754\"><BR> <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":3,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
