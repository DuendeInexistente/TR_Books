The Argonian left on a solo expedition into a seafloor Ayleid ruin near the Mykoi Isles of the northern Abecean Sea, but failed to return at the expected time.<BR><BR>\\r\\nAccording to reports from the Mages Guild, Divides-To-Iron became trapped in a one-way passage deep inside the Ayleid ruin, which he identified as \"Nagaiarelle\". When a Mages Guild %PCRace finally found him, the mage had been living on a diet of fish and a dwindling supply of fresh water for more than three weeks. Because of his unique Argonian physiology, Divides-To-Iron was able to breathe in the ruin's depths, though the salt water made this exhausting.<BR><BR>\\r\\nDespite these difficulties, Divides-To-Iron appears to have taken his ordeal in good humor, telling the Monitor he \"loves seafood\". The Mages Guild made no comment on its future plans regarding explorations of Nagaiarelle.<BR>",
