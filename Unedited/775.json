I have taken it upon myself to devise a system of locks that can defeat such villainous intent.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe materials used to create a lock are of utmost importance. Shoddy brass or copper will give way to a well placed kick, thereby rendering the lock itself useless. I recommend steel over iron when choosing a material. More robust materials tend to be prohibitively expensive and necessitate the door being made of similar metals. I have been chagrined to stumble across the shattered shell of a wooden chest, its dwarven lock intact and still locked.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOnce these basics are settled, pay particular attention to the offset of the tumblers. A seven degree offset to the keyhole will allow a torque style key to work smoothly, while at the same time causing numerous headaches for the thief attempting to insert non-torque lockpicks.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn similar fashion, the springs of the tumblers should be made by different smiths. Each smith will unknowingly create a spring with different tension than his fellow smiths. This variance will also create difficulties for anyone attempting to pick the lock.<BR>\r\n<BR>","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":30,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
