Short one act plays such as the one below are traditionally played by a host of voice actors whose only responsibility is to read the appropriate character's lines, while their counterparts on stage concentrate solely on performing the often dangerous sword-fighting techniques that the genre abounds in.\n\n<BR>***\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >SCENE: An environment vaguely reminiscent of the Dak'fron steppes. Central on the stage is a monolithic rocky plateau, against which Mosedesi is leaning.\n<BR>\nEnter Kaludu. Kaludu explores the scene.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >So wide, these lands. So much to see and know and take in. Does it ever make your head hurt, raga?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >Kaludu draws a sword.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >You were not here last time I passed.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Here, there. If every man said \"I am here\", where would we be at all? Deixis Shift, fifteenth Book of the Hena-Pishatri Doctrine.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Only fourteen Doctrines came to us from the Western Shore, raha.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >You question my knowledge, yet you address me with respect, even before you know my name. Careful, now.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >With reason.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >Kaludu sheaths his sword.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >I have trained under Kezzadogo of Skaven and Heiyanji of Nenapesh and was sword pupil to Djongi, who lives nowhere for long. Then, when there was nothing left to be taught, I came here to seek out Mosedesi, the fabled instructor of the Dakfron steppes. Kezzadogo told me he was nothing but a didactic ideal, upon which I beat my duel-master the next day. Heiyanji saw him in dreams of which she never remembered the ultimate lesson. Djongi met him once in a thirst-vision, before a passing caravan saved him from the sun. \n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >You believe you have found him at last, then?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Surely, the only condition under which a man might quote the Fifteenth Doctrine must be that its secrets would have been useless to him to begin with. I salute you, Raha Mosedesi.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Once more I urge you to be cautious. Though my name may be Mosedesi, I would prefer you do not call me 'raha', for that title belongs to my brother. He is a nobler yet more foolish man than I, and we disagree on a great many things.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Forgive me, raga. \n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Better. What can I teach you?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Anything my previous tutors could not without losing their own advantage. To win.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Fourteen Doctrines you have read and yet you fail to properly define the problem. Win you can - yours, however, is a theoretical issue. Assured victory is what you want. The only victory.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Will you teach me?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Did you not find me?

Begin.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >Kaludu assumes the Throwaway Charge.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Seven seconds from foot to clavicle. Given proper parrying, initiated before I spoke this phrase, three bones of your lower arm shatter with the first blow.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Fool yourself until performance becomes good fortune -- five seconds. It will hold.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >An unorthodox trajectory, but yes, correct. Very well; your turn.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Anticipation Riposte.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Why would you -\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Because you just -\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Impact-In-Hindsight.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Exactly. Continue.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Two-Dimensional Strike. Does a null-width cut bleed?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Two-Dimensional Parry. That is debatable but there is no doubt I can block a null-width blade with my bare hand. \n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >Mosedesi effortlessly removes the sword from Kaludu's hand and returns it immediately.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >You may carry on; the duel bores me.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Raga, before I continue: if you teach me assured victory, a secret you too are partial to, how can that secret's promise ever hold true for the both of us? Surely, you cannot surpass me forever and neither can I ?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >A just question. To answer it we shall start our battle over, but this time as a thought-experiment, which is sibling to proper swordplay, though it often leaves a cleaner cut. Your task is to best me at every opportunity. Allow me to start off easily.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >Mosedesi sheaths his sword and raises his empty left hand.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >No threat in an empty palm, is there?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >On the contrary, raga. Your smile betrays five right-hand strikes that you can count on your left. However, given that digits can only count so far, I counter you with djanensei-trengo, which is one for each of Tava's favored flagships.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Right you are! Better yet, let us not linger in figures that can exist outside of the symbolic. How about, for instance, one for every Walkabout-Way-Beacon that Paparuptga made to light our way? No one has ever counted them, but their number is undoubtedly Too -messa- Big -ra- For Our Heads -dogei !\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Messa-ra-dogei may be too great for our heads, but, surely, that is simply a matter of finding a bigger head. I therefore propose an even greater number of wounds that I -with all due respect, raga- could inflict.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Sep osundi?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >If we counted one for each of Tall Papa's many, many children, then surely that number would rank in the uncountable!\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Sep osundi?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >And at this point any further attempts of yours to add onto this number are doomed to fail, for surely they cannot move it out of the realm of the infinite.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Surely.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Which leads me to conclude that your previous statement cannot -\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >And what if, amwa, one of Papa's many, many beloved children would Walk About for a long time and eventually reach the Shore and say: \"Kind father, now that I am here and my Walking days are over, I too, would like to have children.\" And Paparuptga would broaden his eternal grin and answer: \"Yes, child, you may.\" And afterwards, every other child would follow suit and each would beget many, many children in its own right. Answer me then, how many children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren and so on would Ruptga have sired?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >This reeks of forbidden knowledge. These are feeble eastern sophisms!\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >A compelling argument and nothing more. Say the words, raga. How many?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >A greater infinity.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Surely.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >An utmost curious idea. Nonetheless, you have shown your skill, raga, and you have bested me. I shall take my leave.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >You will do no such thing. Learn from it.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >A flurry of sand obscures Mosedesi's figure, who re-emerges wearing a clay-and-feather mask.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Mosedesi:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >Answer me, raga. Who am I?\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"640F0F\" >Kaludu:<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"000000\" >You are Raga Mosedesi, anon Messa-Ra-Dogei, Too-Big-For-Our-Heads.

You have seen my face and have therefore seen the secret of The Greater Infinity, which is all I or anyone can ever teach you. You can surpass anyone, forever, and cannot be defeated but on your own terms. This then, I hope, is an adequate answer to your question. You may triumph over me, simply because I let you. I salute you, raha.\n<BR>\n<FONT COLOR=\"003300\" >Another flurry of sand, in which Mosedesi disappears entirely. Exit Mosedesi. Kaludu reflects upon the event for a short while and then leaves.
