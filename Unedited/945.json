It is he who shall punish any, sorcerer or spirit, who should reach above their rightful station or dishonor covenant in actions or thought. Miasma be the wretch's part.\\r\\n<br> <br>\\r\\nThe PERYITON, which contains the names, orders and offices of the Hosts of Misrule, their various knowledges, and the charms by which to bind them into visible aspect.\\r\\n<BR> <BR>\\r\\nVOLUME 2: DEMONS OF THE SOUTH <DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_molag.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <br>\\r\\nThe Prince MOLAG BAL or MOLGA or MOLAGHA is the crowned demon of the southern void and appears as a monster with two eyes, one head and four limbs. He is a great and terrible Prince who can make the sorcerer skilled at the corruption and self-inflicted destruction of fellow mortals, but will also try to accomplish the same effect on the sorcerer. He is a sovereign demon of a great host of monsters, and he is quick to lend them to mortals in return for their loyalty. Any familiar that is given out by the Prince is bound by unbreakable chains which grant the sorcerer absolute dominion over it. <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_nocturnal.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <br>\\r\\nThe Prince NOCTURNAL or NOCTAS or NOCTURA is the crowned demon of the southwestern void and appears as a pale woman cloaked in black. She is a secretive Prince who can only be summoned at night. When addressing the Prince, the conjurer should only use whispers and silent gestures or she is likely to vanish. She can reveal the location of all things lost and teaches the sorcerer how to find treasures hidden with magic.<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_horvarrax.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <br>\\r\\nHORVUS and VARRAX; or HORRIN and VARRIN; or SOPPY and SHALKY are the winged heralds of the southwestern void. They are always in the form of two monstrous ravens with feathers of black chitin. They carry the memory and foresight of Nocturnal, and from them it is possible to pry visions from her mind's eye.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_vaermina.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <br>\\r\\nThe Prince VAERNIMA or VAERMINA or VERNIMA or VERINAM is the crowned demon of the southeastern void and appears as the woman of one's dreams whose absolute domain is nightmares. A novice conjurer may seek to converse her asleep by placing pieces of a broken skull under their pillow. Cats refuse to rest where they sense her presence. She teaches the interpreting of dreams and omens and can make the conjurer feared by their mortal peers.\\r\\n<BR> <br>",
