It is likely this Ordinator has since defected and is doing Vehk knows what with the belt.\"<BR><BR>\\r\\nAdditionally, Canyon Echo sources in Othmura down the Thirr river have heard rumor that this particular ordinator may have joined a cult of Mehrunes Dagon worshipers, and surely whatever they have stolen the belt for is due to malicious intent. Should this be true, Milara Orvayn and the Canyon Echo would like to warn readers that dangerous heretics of the House of Troubles should NOT be trifled with, and that the capable hands of loyal Temple warriors are putting in as much effort as they can to recover this historic, blessed artifact.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
