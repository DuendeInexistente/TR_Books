To Dreadmund, most everything of Sea-Elvish was still nothing but incoherent noises, but he did pick up one word.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Did he say 'Orgnum'?\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Yes-Yes-Yes. He said that he is the King Orgnum. And that he would like to duel with you, with the condition that you leave Pyandonea and take your fleet with you if he wins.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDreadmund frowned. \"Tell him that I killed Orgnum.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Bird Elf babbled at the Sea Elf, and the Sea Elf babbled in return. The Bird Elf turned back to Dreadmund. \"He says that he agrees that you killed the King Orgnum, but he insists that he is the King Orgnum.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Ask him what in Hell that means.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"He says that he is the new King Orgnum, that because the old one died he was chosen. He says that the one you killed had lived much longer than he was supposed to, so there were a few in reserve. He says -- \"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Translate directly, foolish thing!\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"'I am the King Orgnum, as chosen by the Hooded Elders who live below the World-Bowels-Tree and the Hooded Serpent who lives in the roots of the same. I climbed down through the jungles to reach the Tree after being Stare-Called by the Elders themselves. I am Serpent-blooded as you are Dragon-blooded. I will defeat you.'\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Heh. What do I get out of dueling with him that I don't get from just killing him?\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe two elves made sounds for a moment. \"You shall be granted the Pasquiniel without resistance, and you shall have a time of respite before the next King Orgnum challenges you.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nA lazy smile played across Dreadmund's face. \"Odd how eager he is to be crushed. I'll humor him. But the last Orgnum chose where he would fight me, so this time I get to choose. We're fighting aboard the Snow Whale.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDreadmund and the second Orgnum, the second Serpentborn, stood across from one another on the ship's deck. Dreadmund readied the Ice Blade of the Monarch, which he had recovered after his battle with the other Orgnum, and this new Orgnum readied his spear. The Ice Blade still hadn't tasted a King's blood, but maybe it would finally get its chance. Dreadmund stared into Orgnum's eyes, and Orgnum Stared back.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOrgnum charged. Dreadmund tried to move, to react, but he realized that he was frozen in place, slowed by the Stare, for Orgnum knew it as the serpents did. A Thu'um rose from Dreadmund's frozen throat and pushed Orgnum back, breaking eye contact and freeing Dreadmund's movement again.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOrgnum Stared a gout of flame, which erupted from his eyes, and Dreadmund Thu'umed the same. The flames crashed together and hissed.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDreadmund spoke another Thu'um from the side of his mouth. It landed beside Orgnum, and there he was, bringing the Ice Blade down upon the elf.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOr not. Orgnum shoved his spear haft in the way, and Dreadmund's blade cleaved straight through, cutting the spearhead from the rest of the shaft. Orgnum twisted out of the way of the blade like the Serpent he was at heart and he grappled with Dreadmund, dropping the shaft of his spear as Dreadmund dropped the Ice Blade. There wasn't space to use spears and greatswords, anymore.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe two rolled across the deck, Thu'um deadlocked with Stare, and Orgnum's hand desperately grasped a weapon, for a coincidental savior. His seeking fingers found the severed spearhead. He held it aloft and brought it down with all his strength, shoving it into Dreadmund's chest.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDreadmund gasped. It hurt him to breath. Orgnum stood and backed away, face triumphant. Insolent elf! Dreadmund began a Thu'um, but before it could leave his lips as a honed weapon, it burped from his side. He screamed in agony. The elf had stabbed into his lung. He Thu'umed again, and again, and as the Thu'ums burped from his side, his wound grew wider and wider. He gave up his Voice as a lost cause; his greatest power made powerless. He rose. He would not fall to this cur. He charged, howling, and made to smash Orgnum in the face, to gouge out his eyes with his claws, to kill him anyway. Orgnum glared daggers at Dreadmund -- literally -- and Dreadmund was pushed back. He tore one of the daggers from his body and charged again armed now with more than his claws and teeth, and Orgnum Stared lightning at him. Again, and Orgnum Stared him unto ice. Again, and Orgnum Stared at Dreadmund with such force that he flew into the Snow Whale's mast and split it. Dreadmund did not rise this time.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHe spoke in hissing Sea Elf tones, and the Bird Elf translated from the side.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"He says, 'Do you surrender? Do you accept my demands? Will you leave, and take your pink men with you?'\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDreadmund roared and rose again, and Orgnum Stared agony into his wounds. Dreadmund fell. He was breathing in only quick, painful gasps now.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBetween gasps, he answered, \"I...accept. We will...leave.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Bird Elf spoke, and Orgnum nodded.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":150,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
