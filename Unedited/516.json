Atop its rocky outcrop, commanding views over the surrounding land, it would have offered a natural defensive position then just as it does today. <BR>\\r\\n <BR>\\r\\nOf its early inhabitants we know little. The city is first recorded as Khalaan, literally \"Heart of Ebony\", a probable reference to the missing god Shezarr who, unusually, was widely worshipped by the elves of this region. The ancient Nordic sagas mention a great temple or monastery dedicated to Shezarr somewhere directly south of Red Mountain and north of Mournhold, which I conjecturally associate with Khalaan- on the basis of admittedly scant evidence. <BR>\\r\\n <BR>\\r\\nThe debate raged for many centuries over which city was founded first- Ebonheart or Mournhold. The geography of Veloth's pilgrimage suggests it is the former that deserves the honor, although significant geological upheaval has occurred since this time which further muddies the metaphorical waters. Either way the two cities were equal rivals for a considerable period, a state of affairs that only came to an end with the emergence of the Tribunal faith and the adoption of Mournhold as the seat of the goddess Almalexia. The conjectured temple of Shezarr may also have vanished around this time, as there are vague references to a \"massacre of monks\" and a \"razing of egregious sanctuaries\". Unfortunately any religious purge was accompanied by an equally thorough cleansing of the historical record- I have seen clear evidence of ancient vandalism in documents describing these events. <BR>\\r\\n <BR>\\r\\nFollowing a period of Nordic rule the city fell into the hands of the House Raathim, a once-powerful Dark Elf aristocratic family. They ruled the city for generations, perhaps growing powerful enough to rival the mighty philosopher-princes of House Indoril and the muck-magnates of House Hlaalu. The city continued to vie with Almalexia for local dominance, and even petitioned Sotha Sil to make his home in the city in order that they might compete with their neighbor on equal terms. The annals record that the god-sorcerer's only response was to silence Ebonheart entirely for a generation, so that no sound could be heard or uttered within its administrative boundaries. The city's inhabitants learned to communicate with looks and secret hand signals, which ultimately aided them in their covert struggles against their neighbours. The silent language of Ebonheart is still used to this day by Dark Elf agents and con artists. <BR>\\r\\n <BR>\\r\\nDespite these upsets the Raathim period was relatively stable, although it was disrupted by the campaign of Tiber Septim. Ebonheart surrendered to Imperial forces but was tragically burned to the ground by religious fanatics. With the signing of the armistice the ruling Raathim were released from captivity and restored to their position, and began a rebuilding program. History reports that the reigning lord of the time, Theranis Raathim, made such an impression on the Emperor with his prowess in friendly melee tournaments that Septim decided to make Ebonheart his new capital in the province. The city was rebuilt in the Colovian style and a great citadel was constructed, to control the route between Vivec and Almalexia's cities. <BR>\\r\\n <BR>\\r\\nThus was a new golden age ushered in. The city of Ebonheart became a model of Imperial civil government and town planning. Additional settlements including Firewatch and Helnim were constructed in imitation of Ebonheart's majesty. The Raathim line even gave rise to an Empress, the great Katariah who re-established trade links with far Yokuda. Although the city was never able to supplant Almalexia as was originally intended, it grew into one of the wealthiest and most peaceful settlements in all Morrowind. For a time its inhabitants proudly declared Ebonheart to be \"The Empire's Second City\". While those heady days are gone, and a \"new\" Ebonheart has been constructed on Vvardenfell, the city today still stands as a comforting beacon of civilization in a strange and sometimes hostile land. <BR>","data":{"weight":1.1,"value":45,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
