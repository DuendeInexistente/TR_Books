Upon intercourse with the star-orphan, the Beseeching Alesstic performs eversion of the organ of thought, an employment of the Hurling Disk that recapitulates the truth that a circle turned sidewise is a Tower. BY the same-truth, twisting the enveloping sheath into the middle dawn (to the number of seventeen) brings it to untime and unplace.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nEventualism, of course, predicts reabsorption upon depletion of the Wheeling Force, but the absence of duration may render even eventuality moot.<BR><BR>",
