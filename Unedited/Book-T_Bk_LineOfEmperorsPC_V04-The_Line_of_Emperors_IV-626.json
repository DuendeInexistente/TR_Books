Reman II wasted no time in putting an end to these uprisings, making clever use of his Tsaeci servants as he did so, sending these brave and loyal warriors first to the north, where they brought down the Nordic rebels, and then south, where they fought the great Battle of Argonia, establishing Imperial Law and the Rule of the Emperors in that stygian land.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nRemembering the ideals of his predecessor, Reman I, who did intend to join all of Tamriel under his rule, and seeing what good his regime did in the newly joined province of Black Marsh, Reman II decided to honor this great ambition, and to that purpose declared war on the lands of Morrowind, for the Dunmer who lived there were in thrall to dark powers, and their resuscitation was a noble goal indeed. For Four-Score years the war against the Dunmer raged, as they were abetted by a dark three-headed spirit, who went by the name of Ephen. With his great endeavor unfinished, Reman II was slain in battle in the year of 1E 2851, and his people did weep over the fall of so mighty a man.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nXII. THE EXPUNGED REMAN<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII. REMAN III<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1E 2877 Reman III did take the throne, fated to be the last of the line of Reman. Brave as his predecessors, Emperor Reman III fought the Dunmer of Morrowind to a standstill, though he was undermined at every turn by treachery and deceit. Even his own consort, the Empress Tavia, conspired against him with revolutionaries and tribesmen of the Blackwood borderlands, who were moved by perverse instincts to struggle against legitimate authority. So it came to be that the Emperor was forced to confine Tavia in the dread prisons of Black Marsh.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThough these actions may seem harsh, Reman III was a more gentle ruler than his predecessors, and was known far and wide for his mercy and kindness. As such, he is remembered by the people of Cyrodiil as a martyr of kindness and good governance, for his enemies did wound him, and killed his only son, and assassinated him as well, on the eve of his triumphant victory over the Dunmer. So the Second Era began, which was an Era of chaos, in which no true Emperor would appear.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his last breath, Reman III entrusted the administration of his Empire to his Tsaeci servant, Versidue-Shaie, who safeguarded the Empire as Potentate for many years, as did his son, Savirien-Chorak. But the lands of Cyrodiil did not prosper under an alien hand, and the Potentates were never a good substitute for the true rule of the Emperors. In time, they too fell to the hands of murderers, and the Empire was left in the delinquent care of the Interregnum Pretenders, a ceaseless flow of hapless warriors and champions who sought the legitimacy that only the White-Gold Throne could ensure. Without a true Emperor, the land was soaked in blood, and the people of Tamriel knew despair.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n",
