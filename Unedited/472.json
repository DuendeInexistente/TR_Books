Some of his followers fell on the wayside, others lost their way, but steadfastly he led the rest on their journey, advancing along his path while never stepping past the Four Corners of the world. Of the Mistakes Veloth encountered, some were redeemed, some remained heedless, and others still sought to destroy the pilgrims who walked a clearer path than they did. <BR> <BR> As Veloth led his people across the span of the world he met with a powerful Mistake at its center: the feathered, crowned sorcerers of the marble wheel. They too had seen the Darkness, but they were arrogant and faithless and sought to bend it to their designs, not perceiving that they themselves had been bent by it. They stood in the way of Veloth and carried his followers off in their talons and proudly pruned their golden feathers, telling the Velothi the falsehoods they had heard before. <BR> <BR> The Velothi heeded their teachings, however, and were not misled. They conjured a Door like that they had seen before and cast the Light of the crowned sorcerers into its Darkness. The lesson of that Door being known to the Velothi, its contents were illuminated, revealing the Door to be the frame of a hearth.\r\n<BR> <BR> In the warmth of the hearth the Velothi could sleep safe from predation, and into the fire of the hearth the Velothi could cast their foes. Turn your knowledge into your strength and your safety. If you can make your surroundings as a house to you, its fires shall not burn you.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR><BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> \r\n<IMG SRC=\"TR\TR_VelothBookArt06.dds\" WIDTH=\"120\" HEIGHT=\"120\"> <BR> Corner of Dispersal <BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR> Veloth could not stay long basking in the warmth of the hearth, and turned instead to the next obstacle. But the next obstacle was obscured by a fog as thick and unfathomable as any wall, yet inviting exploration rather than restriction. <br> <br> Seeking a barrier to surmount, the Velothi wandered forth into the fog with sure step. Yet once within it, they lost sight of their lessons, and did not recognize Mistakes for what they were, inviting them to the warmth of their hearth and giving birth to folly. Even Light and Darkness could not be held apart in that fog. <br> <br> Yet Veloth did not despair at how warped his teachings had become, but remembered his earliest lesson: he looked within himself. There, once again, he found his Light and his Darkness, and as he had a faithful heart the two were clear divided. And as they were reflected within himself, so were they reflected without. <br> <br> Veloth drew the Light away from the Darkness, revealing the fog to be an endless mountain range looming high above his wayward people. He cast the Light back with greater focus and it pierced the mountains, and for the first time the Velothi were able to gaze upon their promised land. <br> <br> No longer confused, their impurities cut through as the mountains themselves had been, the Velothi came home with sure step. When confronted by a new problem, do not neglect old solutions, for they have demonstrated their worth before.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <IMG SRC=\"TR\TR_VelothBookArt07.dds\" WIDTH=\"120\" HEIGHT=\"120\"> <BR> Door of Resolution  <BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR> Having arrived at their destination, the Velothi began settling the land and contemplating the lessons they had learned on their journey, nurturing old knowledge and contemplating new ideas. Yet Veloth's path had not reached its end, and some still followed him as he saw his journey to its conclusion. <BR> <BR> Veloth looked to the final Door, and his persistence revealed a vision: Veloth observed the truths he had seen, and truths he had yet to see. Dusk lay behind him, and he had never admired it, for it brought nothing new. Before him was only dawn, the coming of a new Light, and finally Veloth had an idea of what he was seeking. <BR> <BR> The path of a follower is to contemplate one's lessons and live a good life, but the path of a visionary is to seek new knowledge and to always be on the move. Respect the station you have been given in life and find out how it can best serve you. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <IMG SRC=\"TR\TR_VelothBookArt08.dds\" WIDTH=\"120\" HEIGHT=\"120\"> <BR> Corner of Termination <BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Veloth stood on a promontory looking out over the ocean, an expanse far wider than that he had crossed when leaving his birthplace. Prosperity had come to his people and he was glad at heart, and yet still he stood and faced his final obstacle. <BR> <BR> The demon Mehrunes Dagon rose from the water to meet him, his four arms spread out, each holding a weapon more dreadful than the last. Veloth uttered the lesson of the first Door to dispel the first weapon, uttered the lesson of the second Door to dispel the second weapon, and uttered the lesson of the third Door to dispel the third weapon, but the fourth weapon traced a path around the demon's four hands which revealed the shape of a tomb. <BR> <BR> Perceiving that death had come upon him, Veloth stood in his gray-lit burial chamber and cast his gaze around the room in which he found himself, regarding in turn each Corner and each Door that gave the room its square form. He recognized his Ancestors, as well as Sheogorath, Boethiah, Malacath, Mephala, Molag Bal, Azura and finally Mehrunes Dagon who slew him. <BR> <BR> Yet Veloth was not yet done observing the chamber. He turned his gaze sideways and perceived the Ceiling above him, the Floor below him and the Air in between. These were not dark Corners, nor mysterious Doors, but were familiar, having accompanied him in all his travels. Veloth took a great step forward, his foot rising until it met the Floor above. Completing his step, he raised his head up to the Ceiling below and looked around him. Behind him were the three Doors of Anticipation, in front of him the Waiting Door, around him the Four Corners that had tried to halt him, now inverted and conquered. The Chimer Veloth stepped forth through the Waiting Door, never once having turned back in his journey, and found a new way forward. <BR> <BR> So must we find our way forward, not pining for that which we lost before birth, nor blindly advancing into lands unknown, but embraced by our Ancestors and the true path revealed by ALMSIVI. <BR> <DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">  <IMG SRC=\"TR\TR_VelothBookArt09.dds\" WIDTH=\"120\" HEIGHT=\"120\"> <BR>","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":50,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
