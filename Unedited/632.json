After twenty years of his enlightened reign, Emperor Uriel VII has graciously granted me, Tyr Ymanwe, the privilege of publishing this small addendum to \"The LINE of EMPERORS vol. IX: from CEPHORUS II to MORIHATHA,\" further describing the life and deeds of Pelagius IV. Also included is a preliminary draft of the life of Uriel VII, unfinished, of course, as this scholar sincerely wishes our Emperor many years of good health to come.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIV. PELAGIUS IV SEPTIM<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor Pelagius IV ascended the throne in 3E 339, after the brutal and untimely end of his beloved aunt and predecessor, Morihatha. In his ascension many saw a sign of continuance and unification, as he was named Pelagius, as many of the great and wise Emperors of the original line of Septims, as as such indicated their continuing relevance.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nPelagius IV was quick to continue the good work of Morihatha, pacifying the provinces, and bringing them closer still through a grand investment in the good infrastructure of the Empire, the building of good roads across Tamriel, and bold strongholds to project the mighty hand of the Legions far and wide. If some claim that Pelagius' work of peace was less absolute or durable than that of Morihatha, it should only be noted that the former is continuing this work where the latter did not venture, cracking even the hardest and most obstinate of the provincial rulers. Indeed, the Empire in its present state is more peaceful and unified than ever before, and the legacy of Pelagius IV is sure to continue a hundred years or more.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXV. URIEL VII SEPTIM<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in 3E 368 Pelagius IV passed on to his rightful place by the side of the Divines, the current Emperor, Uriel VII, twenty-first Emperor of the Septim dynasty, ascended the White-Gold throne. Truly, a more splendid ruler has not been seen since the days of Tiber Septim himself! For Uriel VII combines within him the diligent diplomacy of Empress Morihatha, the cunning and patient political acumen of Emperor Uriel VI, and the military genius and foresight of Uriel V.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ten years of his reign, our youthful Emperor has cunningly and with a noble sense of purpose defeated any and all challenges in his path, safeguarding Tamriel from they who would do it harm. In his visage, we see the keystone of this present age, which is in itself the iron foundation of an age yet to come! By the love of the Divines, may his reign continue from the present day for many an age, as may the reign of his sons! The reign of the Septims, now and forevermore!<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":40,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
