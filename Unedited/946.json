It is he who shall punish any, sorcerer or spirit, who should reach above their rightful station or dishonor covenant in actions or thought.

Alone among the monarchy of Oblivion, he can be called upon by the unpracticed, which the wise must take as ample proof of his shrewdness. He can make men wealthy, powerful or beautiful and it is within his power to teach all skills, arts and sciences of the mortal world. The brash sorcerer may court his attention with votive offerings, though the Prince and his subjects generally distrust gifts, for above all else they loathe indebtedness. <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_barbas.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nBARBAS or BARBATIS or BARKAS is a seneschal of the western void. He appears as a great hound, but will take many shapes if so commanded and will speak truth, but incompletely. He teaches rhetoric, wit, and judgment of mortal nature, but will always try to break his bonds by deceit. <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_bittercup.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nBITTERCUP or NARXISSA is a governess of the western void. She appears as a maid with crow's feet, flowers on her hair, and bearing a copper chalice. Depending on the summoning day the wine in the chalice will be either sweet or bitter or both. She teaches the strong to be stronger and the wise to be wiser, but weakens the already weak and further dulls the minds of simpletons. <BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_sheogorath.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nThe Prince SHEOGORATH or SHEOGOG or SEGGOZAR or SHEGGAR or SHEROGOL is the crowned demon of the far-western void and appears as an Emperor of Men who has lost his mind. He is an erratic and a dangerous prince whose mood can change without reason or warning. While summoning him is difficult making deals with him is even harder. He can cause madness or indecision and makes mortals change their minds on previous decisions.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_haskill.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nHASKILL or KILL or KILL or KILL is the lord chamberlain of the far-western void. He appears as a slender gentleman who always acts in a very controlled fashion. Though his powers are limited, negotiations with Sheogorath often go through him and his seemingly mild manners make him more popular among novice conjurers.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\n<BR> <IMG SRC=\"TR\\peryiton_wabbajack.dds\" WIDTH=\"240\" HEIGHT=\"240\"> <br> <DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"> <BR>\\r\\nWABBAJACK or WABBALAG or JAGGALAG is an orderly of the far-western void and appears as a scrawny knight carrying a walking stick. He was once a mighty demon, but his powers have since diminished. He can force others to change their appearance into anything, but can never transform himself. \\r\\n<BR> <br>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":200,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
