You can be diagnosed with Corprus by doing so little as brushing unclothed skin with the infected, or breathing the same air for a long period of time. Dagoth Ur, leader of the outlawed Sixth House, who is trapped at Red Mountain by the Dunmer people's Ghostfence, claims responsibility for the Corprus disease's rampant outbreak. His ash creatures are able to curse others with the disease, we've been told by Vvardenfell resident Legion veterans. However, the Ghostfence cannot contain the ash storms which seem to be the source of the infection. Do not travel through the Ashlands while wearing revealing clothing, or leaving your mouth or nostrils exposed. Our evidence suggests that this is how the blight and Corprus are spread and contracted. \"Only when the devil Dagoth Ur is slain will the storms stop,\" several Dunmer were quoted in saying. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt has yet to spread beyond Vvardenfell, thanks to the efforts of the mainland guards charged with containment of both it and the blight, trained to identify symptoms of both. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is no known cure for the Corprus disease, but those infected within Vvardenfell should report to Divayth Fyr, master of Tel Fyr, immediately. He is currently tirelessly conducting tests for a cure, and while none of them as of this day have succeeded in ridding his patients of the infection, he presses on with his research optimistically. Those who are experiencing symptoms outside of Vvardenfell, for whatever reason, should instead report to the nearest shrine of the Imperial Cult. You can have a healer treat you, if you are infected, but that will only prolong the effects for twenty-four hours at best. The disease will resume destroying your body and your mind there afterwards. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSymptoms and How to Identify Corprus <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPeople diagnosed with Corprus experience frequent rashes in the earlier stages of the infection, itchy skin that is prone to flake with irritation (itching, rubbing, even lightly), bleeding pores, an urge to vomit after meals. After living with the infection for less than a week, the irritated skin will begin to fall off the body, and the person will grow pale. Their bones will then twist out of shape, making it increasingly difficult to walk or lift things, and where the skin fell off, more will grow over the exposed tissue in bubbly, swollen growths. The infected person will also grow increasingly lazy. In another few days, they are unable to consume liquids or food of any kind, and will proceed to regurgitate them shortly after consumption. When starvation and dehydration are imminent, the infected will find themselves unable to complete basic tasks like reading, writing, speaking, and identifying friends and loved ones. This is when an infected person will become increasingly violent and hostile, and take on an entirely different personality, or an absence of one, and begin to attack living things on sight. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThose with the disease tend to not attack others who are also infected. They have been said to also yield to Dagoth Ur's army of ash beasts, and even take orders from them. <BR>\r\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":25,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
