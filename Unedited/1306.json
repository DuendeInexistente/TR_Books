Symptoms of greydust usage include erratic and violent behavior, lack of appetite leading to dangerous weight loss, and a pale grey pallor to the skin of users who are nearing death.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a statement to The Canyon Echo by Deputy Captain of the Watch Andres Hlaalo, the Ja-Natta Syndicate is the sole producer of greydust. While Temple alchemists have attempted to identify the formula for the dangerous drug, they have not yet been successful, according to Diviner Farona Darvel. This suggests that members of the Ja-Natta Syndicate are skilled alchemists. Representatives of the Guild of Mages have declined to comment.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nSyndicate members are also reported to be organized and violent. If Narsis citizens witness mixed-race groups who are lightly armored and wielding blunt weapons, or carrying no weapons at at all, moving through the streets or outlying country with purpose, they are advised not to attempt to confront the group. Official advice from the City Watch is to report such activity to your nearest Hlaalu Guard.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-time readers may recall The Canyon Echo's article on the 4th of Rain's Hand reporting on the growing numbers of controlled enchanted weapons, such as spark-, jink-, and viperblades, moving through Morrowind's smuggling networks. Further investigation has revealed that this activity may also be connected to the Ja-Natta Syndicate, who are known for their use of enchanted weapons.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nViolent turf wars in Narsis' sewers may also be tied to a Syndicate presence. \"I'm scared to do my job,\" said a maintenance worker, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. \"Every day there's a fresh bloodstain on the tiles, or a body floating in the water. You hear screams echoing through the tunnels. It's like a battlefield down there.\" Until recently, gang activity in the sewers has been kept under control by the Camonna Tong. If the Syndicate is challenging the Tong for control of the sewers, this may lead to an explosion of independent criminal activity.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizens of Narsis must hope that the City Watch can bring the Ja-Natta Syndicate under control, and arrest its unknown leadership, before the violence erupts onto Narsis streets. \"We are co-operating with the Imperial Legion to track down the leadership of the Ja-Natta Syndicate,\" said Andres Hlaalo, \"They have been diligent in fighting the Syndicate since it emerged in Tear, but so far have been unable to locate the powers behind the organization.\" While Hlaalo declined to comment on House Redoran in his statement, he confirmed that the City Watch were investigating sources of Syndicate activity downriver. The Canyon Echo has reached out to Felmaru Llendu, House Redoran governor of Ald Iuval, for comment, but the Echo has received no reply.<br>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
