  "text": "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\\r\\nHis<BR><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nIt was time before unity and before peace, when Vehk, Ayem, and Seht walked the land together with the Hortator, bringing enlightenment to the Chimer people and driving out the men of the cold north.<BR>\\r\\nVehk was traveling with his warband when he came across the holdings of Bhag, the great bearded king who was in possession of two tongues.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThis was a time before Bhag had declared his intentions towards the triune crown, and Vehk approached him peacably, asking for rest and the right to recruit more warriors from Bhag's holdings, for Vehk foresaw many battles to come with the unholy quintet, and believed he could convince Bhag to fight for him, if for a little time only.<BR>\\r\\nBut Bhag refused, saying only those great men or women with many other great men and women working for him or her would be permitted access to his halls.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nRather than attempting to take Bhag's holdings by force -- which Vehk could clearly see would be a campaign of decades, if not centuries -- Vehk instead honored the warlord by going to work for him. In doing so, Vehk ingratiated himself to a large number of the warlord's own retainers, thereby convincing them to work for Vehk as well as for Bhag.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHence when Bhag asked who served Vehk, Vehk answered that the people of the city were now \"his\", and Bhag saw that it was so.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBut Bhag was crafty and knew that the servitude of one person, one generation, could not last forever; a holding's future lay in its children. He himself had many children, some grown as old as Vehk himself, and he brought these forth and showed them to Vehk, asking him how he could expect to gain the respect of the city's people long after he and the people who served him were in the grave.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVehk, seeing this, agreed with the old warlord, and set about convincing some of the holding's women to bear him heirs. He then encouraged those heirs to marry with the old warlord's kin and produce yet more heirs through them. So when Bhag asked who owned the hold's future, Vehk said that it had become \"his\".<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHence Bhag then turned to the stories of the past. He himself came from a long lineage of great warlords, who deeds were painted on the hold's walls and kept forever in memory in their scrolls and books. Then he asked Vehk what his own lineage was and if he truly believed Vehk's deeds were greater than any of his own.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo this, Vehk burned the books and debraded the walls. He presented the ashes and blank stones to Bhag, then drew upon them with his milk finger, telling him that Bhag's history was now \"his\" as well. Then Vehk slew the old warlord.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVehk then bore the head to the Hortator so his friend could see and remark upon his cleverness. And when Nerevar asked to whom the great hoary head belonged, Vehk smiled, and said it was \"his\".<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n",
