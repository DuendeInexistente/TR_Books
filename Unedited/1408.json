Though its surroundings are bleak, ashen, and dangerous, within the walls of Firewatch a traveler may forget that they are not in one of the pleasant cities of the west. Despite their many hardships and privations in the crises of recent decades, the residents of Firewatch retain a hardy pride for their fine city at the edge of the world.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Firewatch has become a center of commerce and academic thought, but the city retains a martial character from its origins as a crude coast fortress in the days of the Armistice. Duchess Perulia Jandacia rules from Ember Keep, her fortified palace in the Old Fortress, which also hosts the local offices of the Imperial Commission. Fort Dustmoth, headquarters of the storied Dustmoth Legion, stands just across the courtyard. From miles away, a traveler may behold Firewatch's most recognizable landmark, the Drakelight Beacon, which remains the tallest Imperial structure in the Eastern Provinces even a century after its construction.\r\n\r\nFirewatch's famously large harbor, built to accommodate the grand host of the doomed Far East Fleet's northerly contingent, today has embraced its role as a commercial hub for northeastern Tamriel. Its deep berths host merchant vessels from as far afield as Bal Foyen, Winterhold, and Port Mare, bringing fine goods from the Sea of Ghosts and the Padomaic Ocean. The East Empire Company's district headquarters are found here, ever industrious in its commitment to bring fine eastern goods to the good people of the west. Travelers arriving in Firewatch should declare any imports to the Census and Excise Office, which sits adjacent to the regional headquarters of the Inner Sea Fleet.\r\n\r\nReaders are advised to bypass Uriel's Quarter, a neighborhood of ill repute hosting an infestation of pickpockets and gamblers whose proclivities shame the memory of the beloved War-Emperor. The Hanging Noose tavern, the epicenter of this vice, should be avoided in particular. Instead, the wise traveler should make for the Market Quarter, where respectable merchants offer bargains on fine goods from Firewatch's many sister ports. The Queen's Cutlass, the city's best inn, can be found here; there is no finer accommodation in all the northeast. Those inclined towards mercenary work may seek it out at the Fighters Guild near the north gate.\r\n\r\nVaynth Quarter, Firewatch's newest district, is the epicenter of its modern reinvention as a renowned center of learning. The College of Firewatch, one of the finest educational institutions in the Eastern Provinces, permits visitors to occasionally observe lectures by its highly qualified faculty. The district branch of the Briricca Private Bank can be found here, alongside the Mages Guild and a number of high-class merchants.\r\n\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\r\nRegion Information\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\nFirewatch is surrounded on three sides by the badlands of northern Telvannis District, the most hostile of Morrowind's mainland Districts. Consequently, the city's outlook has traditionally been towards the sea, and to this day there are few good roads out into the backcountry.\r\n\r\nDagon Urul\r\n\r\nThe Dagon Urul wasteland is an ashen expanse of hills and cliffs that sprawls across the northwestern third of Telvannis. Mount Sarrunabi, a volcano of frightful size dwarfed only by its counterpart on Vvardenfell, lies at the region's center, just northeast of Firewatch. It is often difficult to tell, when the ash storms rage across the region, whether the ash and dust in the air has come from Red Mountain, Mount Sarrunabi, or both at once. Indeed, Dagon Urul is no place for the faint of heart.\r\n\r\nThe region is known for its prominent Dwarf ruins, most notably Bthalag-Zturamz, which perches on a coastal promontory just south of Firewatch's walls. This region's ruins, however, are simply too dangerous to recommend to sightseers -- even their exteriors are often haunted by the still-crawling automata of the ancient Dwarves. Indeed, there is little to recommend to a civilian traveler beyond Firewatch's walls at all. The only Imperial outposts in these benighted lands were scoured away by the chaos of the Simulacrum, and an unwary tourist is likely to be set upon by wild animals or taken captive by hostile Dark Elves.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"tr\firewatch_region_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"377\" HEIGHT=\"566\"><BR> <BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":3,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
