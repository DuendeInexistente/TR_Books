arsis_district_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"377\" HEIGHT=\"377\"><BR><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\nMorrowind is the northeasternmost province of the Tamrielic Empire, bordered on the north and east by the Sea of Ghosts, on the west by Skyrim, on the southwest by Cyrodiil (also known as the Imperial Province), and on the south by Black Marsh (also known as Argonia). Narsis District encompasses the southwestern corner of the province, a stretch of land bounded by the Velothi Mountains and the border to Cyrodiil to the west, the desert canyons of Shipal-Shin and the border to Black Marsh to the south, the Thirr River basin to the east, and the dusty Armun Ashlands to the north.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNarsis District is the heart of House Hlaalu trade; its cities, including Narsis, Kragenmoor, Andrethis, and Hlerynhul, are heavily populated and have had a history of mingling with nations of men for centuries. The many towns in the interior of the district are decently populated centers of agriculture and manufacturing, while the canyons to the south surrounding the city of Narsis are thinly populated, hosting tribal bandits and natural predators.<BR>\\r\\nNarsis District has four major geographic regions, each with their own distinctive plants and terrain features. These geographic regions are called: the Coronati Basin, the Othreleth Woods, Shipal-Shin, and the Velothi Mountains.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><BR>\\r\\nCORONATI BASIN<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Coronati Basin is a fertile region centered on Lake Coronati, which lies at the intersection of the great Thirr River and one of its main tributaries, the Kanit River. The area includes Hlerynhul, Othmura, Ald Iuval, Ald Marak, and Sadrathim, as well as the lake itself and the streams, bogs, and mangroves that encircle it. The city of Hlerynhul is fairly densely populated, with many plantations, trade towns, and fishing villages surrounding it. The climate is humid around the water and mangroves, with a fair amount of rainfall, but is more arid further away from the shoreline.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHlerynhul is the seat of Hlaalu Councilor Ivul Hleryn, who has made his fortune by taxing and regulating trade across the Kanit and Thirr Rivers. The city is accessible mainly by boat, and hosts many services and points of interest, including the Chapel of Dibella.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOthmura is a small trade town on the Thirr River route from Narsis to Old Ebonheart or Bal Foyen.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAld Iuval, along with its complement on the other side of the Thirr River, Ald Marak, are the remnants of the Waters March; they are the two standing Redoran towns in Narsis District.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSadrathim is a tiny fishing village, hosting the Chapel of Stendarr. It is the ancestral home of Clan Sadras of House Hlaalu.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><BR>\\r\\nOTHRELETH WOODS<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Othreleth Woods are dense woods of tall mushrooms surrounding the Kanit River, north of the desert canyons of Shipal-Shin and south of the dusty Armun Ashlands. The city of Kragenmoor lies on its western border, with Andrethis in the heart of the region. The villages of Reluran, Hla Rud, Ilaanam, Fervinthil, and Narun lie along the river Kanit, with Narusa Winery along Veloth's Path. Tiny farms and mines abound in the Othreleth Woods, as well as ruined Redoran and Reman Empire fortifications from the past. The woods experience high humidity and heavy rainfall on average.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nKragenmoor is a densely populated city near Shadowgate Pass at the end of the Blue Road. Its population is highly diverse due to its proximity to Cyrodiil, and the city's rule is contested between Hlaalu Councilors Llaasa Indarys and Edayn Sadras. Kragenmoor has seen a recent boom in trade from Nibenay, rivaling Narsis in economic prosperity.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAndrethis lies at the heart of the Hlaalu logging and shipbuilding industries; it hosts the residence of Councilor Rhetixia Cheynoslin. Roads lead northwest to Kragenmoor, and southeast to Hlerynhul and Narsis.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nReluran, Hla Rud, Ilaanam, Fervinthil, and Narun are small villages scattered through the Othreleth Woods with access to the Kanit River.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNarusa Winery, just off the road from Veloth's Path, is home to Hlaalu Councilor Falena Narusa, one of the largest producers of shein and greef in Morrowind.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><BR>\\r\\nSHIPAL-SHIN<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe red canyons of Shipal-Shin rise up far to the south adjoining the Valus Mountains, forming a natural border both with Cyrodiil and Black Marsh. Isolated Hlaalu settlements can be found in the canyons, with inhabitants tilling the red soil and tending the sparse foliage. The most prominent city of Shipal-Shin is Narsis, the capital of House Hlaalu, grown grand and decadent from the wealth gained by supplying the Empire's failing Black Marsh settlements. Other towns in the region include Shipal-Sharai and Salvelis, with Hlaalu plantations, Imperial border forts, and Shinathi camps dotting the canyons. Shipal-Shin is mostly dry and dusty, with some rainfall around the source of the river Thirr.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNarsis is the second most populous city in Morrowind after Almalexia, and perhaps the most wealthy. Ruled by Grandmaster Athires Hlaalu, the city hosts district headquarters of most Imperial Guilds and native factions, including the Hlaalu Council Company and the Measurehall, both centers of Hlaalu finance and administration. The Imperial Proconsul to Morrowind, Galvus Pottreid, also keeps a palace in the city, and Duke Fethas Hlaalu resides in Riverkeep, on the outskirts alongside major plantations of Clans Dren and Vedas.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nShipal-Sharai is a caravan town, fueled by traders on the Purple Road from Mir Corrup to Narsis, but it has been experiencing hardships due to the failure of the local sapphire mine.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSalvelis is a small village in the northwesternmost reaches of Shipal-Shin, close to the southern Velothi Mountains.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nShipal Shin is home to the Shinathi, tribal brigands who make a living in the highlands extorting travelers and herding insects. The Gan-Ettu, Nasar, Ussiran, Hunza, Kuzali, and Ayahali tribes all have permanent camps around the region.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><BR>\\r\\nVELOTHI MOUNTAINS<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNarsis District also includes the southern region of the Velothi Mountains, the towering bulwark that separates Morrowind from the provinces of Cyrodiil and Skyrim. Aside from some small farms on the outskirts of Kragenmoor, the only settlement in the region is the border fort of Shadowgate Pass. The southern Velothi Mountains are cold and stark compared to the heat and humidity of most of Narsis District, with occasional snowfall.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":3,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
