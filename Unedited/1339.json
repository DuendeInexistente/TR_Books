Only a few trinkets missing -- to my eye at least.\" While a proper inventory has not yet been taken, and the Riverkeep treasury is unable to surmise just how much has been taken at this time, it has been confirmed that several expensive Daedric throwing stars have been taken by the thief.<BR><BR>\r\nThis thief -- whose identity the Imperial and Hlaalu guard are currently investigating -- should not be feared by the common citizen. It is important to recognize, dear reader: Should such a foul criminal of the highest dishonour strike again, our loyal and dependable Canyon Watch stewards are sure to handle it swiftly and efficiently.<BR><BR>\r\n\"I will not be played. Not by some petty thief, mark my words,\" said Duke Fethas Hlaalu, furious at his wronging.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
