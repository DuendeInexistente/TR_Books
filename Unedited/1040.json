This document has been glyph-marked, and any breach of confidentiality will be observed and reported.*<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>\\r\\nConcerning: pertinent information regarding his Imperial Majesty's WEIR GATE and SHIFT GATE networks, as used by his Imperial Majesty's military, administrative and diplomatic services\\r\\n<BR><BR>\\r\\nIt has come to my attention that the nature of the Weir Gate network is not fully understood by junior officers and adjutants, some of whom have requested access for personal reasons, including private vacations, sight-seeing, and visits to significant others.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Weir Gate network is a secure interprovincial and interplanar instantaneous teleportation network to be used only for Empire Actual affairs. This system has been with us since the days of Reman and his Mananaut corps, when it was used to connect mundial garrisons directly to mothship beachheads out in the Void.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn today's age, when extramundial excursions of a military nature are no longer commonplace, the Weir network has been refurbished as secure transport for high-ranking military officers and messengers.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Weir Gate system has several advantages over more commonplace means of teleportation:\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWeir Gates are more reliable, as they cannot be interrupted by resonators or other anti-teleportation machines.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWeir Gates function autonomously, not through a spell cast by a fallible or potentially compromised mage.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWeir Gates do not require a specific spiritual anchor point other than the receiving gate, which can be mounted on a ship or thaumatic vessel, making them essentially mobile (albeit too unwieldy for this to be practical in wartime -- I would advise junior officers to keep their strategy proposals to themselves).\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nFinally, the range on Weir Gates is nearly unlimited, making travel from one side of the Empire to the other -- or even from Tamriel to the reaches of the Void -- a distinct possibility.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhile the current network only connects mundial nodes, it at one point bridged many ships in the Second Empire Void Fleet. Not all of those vessels were recovered and safely disposed of. As such, it is possible for the system to be compromised by extramundial forces (I will refrain from mentioning the recent fiasco suffered by our esteemed colleagues in the Battlemage corps). As such, the secure usage of the Weir Gates is a prime concern at all times.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn short, the Weir Gate network is one of the most important arcane tools in the Legion's arsenal, and should not be used to visit your grandmother in Sentinel or your favorite brothel in Senchal. Any further requests for gate access for personal reasons will be rejected out of hand, and the offending parties disciplined.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nLegion command has received several questions regarding Shift Gates. The existence and functionality of Shift Gates is a state secret. Any inquiry into their workings will result in demotion and a full military investigation. If you hear or see any mention of Shift Gates, you must detain the offending individual and report them to your nearest superior officer.\\r\\n<BR><BR>\\r\\nThis memorandum has been approved by:\\r\\nTherus Alorius\\r\\nLord-General\\r\\nKnight of the Imperial Dragon\\r\\nin service to His Terrible Majesty Uriel Septim VII\\r\\n<BR><BR>\\r\\nThe Empire is Law\\r\\nThe Law is Sacred <BR>","data":{"weight":1.0,"value":60,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
