The disgraced official was caught skimming ebony from the Vvardenfell mine, a grave offense as the precious resource is the sole domain of the Emperor. Investigation then revealed further acts of property fraud and racketeering. With the corruption in Caldera eliminated, the Empire can await even greater returns from the lucrative Caldera mining venture.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nBELLMAN INVESTMENT TIPS<BR>\\r\\nBY MASTER TRADER JOLUS HERDANE<BR><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nNow, readers, you've grown to trust me through the dozens of high-quality tips I've given you in past years.
