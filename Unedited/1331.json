The EEC's refusal to contract a local Dunmer Tong or the proud Shinathi people of Shipal Shin, as well as the erasure of traditional familial agriculture can only mean one thing: the Empire's ruthless expansion both territoriality and monetarily will not stop, and it falls to hard working, dignified citizens of Morrowind to resolve this injustice.<BR><BR>\r\nWhile this may aid Narsis' economy in the short term -- EEC stocks rising at the Mesa Exchange as outlander excitement gets ahead of itself -- it is sure to poison the future prospects of the city and House Hlaalu should nothing be done to prevent these overzealous, expansionist western corporations.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
