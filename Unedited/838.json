This present volume concerns itself with the remaining four.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFourth Family<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Fourth Family was formed in Veloth's time alongside the Second and Third Families, and they changed their name to the variant spelling \"Hlaalo\" as a gesture of submission to the Second Family after seeing what had happened to the Third during the House War. During the turmoil between the Second and Third Families, they left Narsis and sailed up the Kanit River to less-contested lands.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCurrently, the Matriarch of the Fourth Family, Ervesa Hlaalo, lives on the Hlaalo Plantation between Andrethis and Hlerynhul. Taking advantage of the opening of Vvardenfell, her son Ralen Hlaalo built a manor in Balmora and the family holds some influence there.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFifth Family<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Fifth Family began during the Age of the Warring Houses. They arrived in Kragenfell when it was ruled by the Dwemer, and profited by being regional middlemen between the Dwemer and the proto-Redoran. When the Dwarves of Kragen left with the Rourken, the Redoran took control of the area and the Fifth Family lost prominence.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn the Second Era, Great House Hlaalu began to buy land in and around Kragenmoor, causing the Fifth Family to rise in prominence once again. As a result, Garnas Hlaalu is now one of the most important nobles in Kragenmoor, after the patriarchs of Clan Indarys and Sadras. However, the family exerts little influence in the broader Othreleth Woods and thus remains the least influential of the remaining families of Clan Hlaalu.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSixth Family<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Sixth Family was formed during the First Council, when there was finally peace among the Velothi. Taking advantage of this newfound security, the Sixth Family went beyond the Hlaalu corner of Morrowind for business ventures; they traded slaves with the Alessians and acquired oddities from the Cantemeric Velothi, silver from the Kothringi, and slaves from Elsweyr. The family bought properties nearly everywhere they traded, establishing themselves as worldly mer.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWar with Reman put a damper on the business ventures of the Sixth Family, but under the Akaviri Potentates and the subsequent collapse of the Second Empire, business returned to normalcy. The Sixth Family were the initial contact Tiber Septim had with House Hlaalu, and once Morrowind had been incorporated as a province in the Third Empire, the Sixth Family was integral in the creation of the Hlaalu Council Company, a tool designed to compete with the East Empire Company. The property they had bought over the millenia became Council Company offices, contributing to their modern day inter-provincial influence.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Sixth Family has an ancestral manor in the Market Quarter of Narsis, but their interests lie mainly outside of Morrowind. Their patriarch, Dendras Hlaalu, is a member of the Empire's Elder Council, and much of the family lives in Cyrodiil.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSeventh Family<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Seventh Family of Clan Hlaalu was founded by High Hlaalu Brevur, who died in the Seyda Neen disaster. The Seyda Neen was the flagship of a fleet that Hlaalu sent to sea at the behest of a Saint, \"to see the face of Veloth\". The sailors on this voyage were to send back for Narsis when they had found this \"face\". The exact circumstances of the quest are not entirely known, except by the lorekeepers of the Seventh Family themselves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTragically, a powerful storm destroyed the fleet and only the debris floated back to the shore. The Hlaalu used this to construct a lighthouse they called the Grand Pharos, so that any of their countrymer that may have survived the storm could find their way back. House nobles embedded their flagship's glass in their foreheads to commemorate the accident, and the descendents of Brevur formed a new identity based on this event.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nToday, their influence is widespread but not as consolidated as some of the other families. The Seventh Family, headed by Belron Hlaalu, maintains ties to both the East Empire Company and the Hlaalu Council Company, and they own several ships in the Narsis Waterfront. Their manor lies in this district, housing artifacts from the Seyda Neen disaster, as does the famous statue of their founder Brevur Hlaalu.<BR>","data":{"weight":3.5,"value":50,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
