The infamous necromancer, who disappeared in the chaotic years after the reconquest of Anvil, was thought dead for over a century before the Guild found him in the depths of Valsar, a ruined Ayleid citadel in the Strident Coast region.<BR><BR>\\r\\nEdroth had assembled an army of reanimated undead in his lair, and was no doubt plotting some grievous new attack on the people of the Kingdom of Anvil. The Monitor joins the Queen in thanking the Mages Guild for their efforts to protect the public and stamp out those who abuse magic wherever they are found.<BR>",
