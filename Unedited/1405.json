Dragonstar East is the westernmost holding of the Nordic Kingdom of the Reach, ruled in the name of King Barda of Markarth Side by Jarl Jona of clan Fire-Hand. The western city, meanwhile, remains under the control of Redguard Crowns, the last remnant of Hammerfell's northern Karthwasten Tomba. During the crises of the Imperial Simulacrum, Legion forces hastily erected a wall between the city's occupied areas to put a stop to the brutal fighting within the city. The wall stands to this day, and a careful traveler will take care when crossing.\r\n<BR>\r\nJarl Jona \"the Ansei-Ender\" rules her holdings from Castle Dragonstar in the eastern city. Dragonstar East is also home to the city's Arena and its Fighters Guild, though the latter has been defunct since the war. Only one establishment, the Shadowkey Tavern, offers rooms in the east, but travelers seeking only gossip and refreshments might seek out Ildgar's Alehouse. Much of Dragonstar East was heavily damaged during the war, and some areas have not been reconstructed.\r\n<BR>\r\nThe western half of the city, ruled by Prince Alak'tol since his narrow childhood escape from his former seat at Karthwasten, suffered less damage during the war. Dragonstar West is home to the city's Grand Bazaar, as well as its Mages Guild chapter. Travelers seeking accommodations have more options in the western city; both the Dragon Fountain Inn and Nukra-Tikil Tavern offer beds for rent.\r\n<BR>\r\nVisitors to Dragonstar should be aware that travel across the Imperial-maintained dividing wall is heavily restricted. Additional precautions should be taken to ensure personal safety; politically-driven violence is common on both sides of the wall.\r\n<BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\r\nRegion Information\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"sky\dragonstar_region_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"377\" HEIGHT=\"377\"><BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\nDragonstar lies in the upper reaches of the Druadach Highlands, where it commands the Tro-Tuktura canyon pass to Hammerfell. Outside the eastern walls sits Taurus Hall, headquarters of the Imperial Legion in the Highlands.\r\n<BR>\r\nDruadach Highlands\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Druadach Highlands are a barren, windy region, and the ancestral homeland of the Reach's native population. One such village of Reach-folk, called Mairager, lies just east of Dragonstar. Members of the Alovach tribe here often trade with the city, and some of its number choose to live in Dragonstar permanently. Three mesas enclose the city on its other three sides: Coimeaden Mesa to the north, Darvacriag Mesa to the west, and Briag Cnoss to the south. Coimeaden is the most desolate of the three, hosting only a pair of ancient Direnni Elf ruins, Angturiel and Celera. Darvacriag is controlled by the Taliesinn tribe of Reach-folk, who live both in settlements of their own making and in the remains of the great Direnni citadel Vars Tharrnil. Friendly Reachmen of the Pachkanan tribe control Briag Cnoss. The mesa once hosted several Redguard villages, though all were destroyed by the war.\r\n<BR>\r\nWestern Vorndgad Forest\r\n<BR>\r\nThe vast Vorndgad Forest covers the terrain east of Dragonstar and the Druadach Highlands. This side of Karthgad, the most notable landmark is the forbidding ancient Nord fortress Vastangar. The ruined Direnni outpost Amrothal can also be found far to the north, on a hill overlooking farmland on the edges of the barren Falkheim region.\r\n<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":3,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
