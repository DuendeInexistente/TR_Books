LET no Child say that elves and their frigid demons are not the greatest evil.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nII. For in the bitter cold they watched the building of the World, and shivered in jealous admiration.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIII. The World is a series of Breaths, a sustained Shout that fills the frosted void of ALDUIN's permissive ignorance.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIV. With Kyne's first Breath, the snowy World-Throat was raised, and the elf-demons cried out in shame.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nV. With Kyne's second Breath, the chilled valleys were cut, and the elf-demons bit their tongues in despair.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVI. With Kyne's third Breath, the icy rivers ran forth, and the elf-demons cut their flesh in loathing.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVII. With Kyne's fourth Breath, sleet-flecked life covered the land, and the elf-demons debased one another in horror.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVIII. With the fifth and most sublime Breath of Kyne, the Children of the Sky were born mighty and free, and the elf-demons howled oaths of destruction. And the snowy elves, demon-thralls without number, swore upon death and marched in all directions. And with them did War come into the World.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nMeditate on this: Kyne breathed five times to work this World. Measure your own Breath, for from a measured Breath are great works wrought.\\r\\n<BR> <BR>\\r\\n",
