And yet, this simple farmer was said to be barely able to speak himself -- let alone make a guar speak. He was almost certainly illiterate, without any education, familial connections, or political ties. Stated plainly, this dull farmer had no means at his disposal to play such a trick.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSurely then, reader, you've considered that some other party was playing a trick on Balyn. Perhaps some unseen wizard crouched in the bushes and staged the initial nix-hound attack, then used magical powers to force a burst of air through the guar's gullet and manipulated its airways just so, playing it like a giant fleshy flute, to create the illusion of speech -- then followed Balyn into town, still unseen, on numerous occasions, to continue the ruse for years?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nLet us also consider the amount of arcane talent that would be needed to manipulate the creature as supposed above without immediately killing it. This would require the attention of a very talented (and apparently very bored) wizard. I ask, dear reader, that you consider the following -- what master wizard would bother with such a thing? How astonishingly drunk would a Telvanni mage have to become before dreaming up such a task?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSo then let us discuss another possibility, more implausible still, but worth ruling out: perhaps this talking guar was the result of some manner of Daedric trickery? Perhaps the beast was influenced by forces from afar? I see no reason to believe this, simply because the farmer lived for nearly another twenty years after the guar's eventual death, with no apparent madness or tragedy occurring.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe trickster Daedra, such as Sheogorath and his servants, rarely act with much subtlety -- once their game is through, their playthings usually walk no more amongst the living, or are otherwise broken in dramatic fashion. I find it hard to believe that any Daedra would have simply chosen to warn a farmer of a nix-hound attack, then slightly enrich him with petty sums of gold for the next several years, without consequence.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe fourth explanation appears on the surface to be the most reasonable - that the entire story is a fabrication. A legend, a tall tale, a misrembrance told across generations. And indeed, I would assume this to be the case.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n In my quest for answers, however, I have managed to find original correspondence from contemporary witnesses. This does not prove that the story is true -- but it does prove that it is not a modern fabrication, and people of the time did in fact report a talking guar.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn researching this tale, I visited the tax and census office of Old Ebonheart, where Vhul's taxes were processed in Balyn's time. Tax and census data is typically considered to be highly private and restricted, but the records of deceased individuals can be accessed using a Historical Inquiry Request. Say what you will of the Empire's cultural influence in our lands, but they have always proven to be superb record keepers.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI uncovered an official letter from Goras Indavel, a local tax collector whose jurisdiction included Vhul at the time. He wrote a report back to his regional post which mentioned an encounter with \"a guar that spoke as a man.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThese reports were official documents, and tax collectors were required to report on any irregularities or notable events in the course of performing their duties. Each report was signed under an honor-oath which extended to the financial data logged within. It was thus a high crime against the Tribunal to lie on such a report.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWe can then say with a high degree of confidence that Goras Indavel did indeed witness a talking guar -- or at least genuinely believed that he had. There would be no incentive to make such an outlandish claim on an official document. Dated 14th of Rain's Hand, 3E 358, the relevant text states:<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Returned to the inn in Vhul after spending the day collecting dues to the north of the town. Was surprised to meet one Balyn Omathan in the street outside the inn, accepting coins for the display of a guar that spoke as a man. I tossed him a coin out of curiosity, and indeed the creature spoke. It asked me where I was from and even told a dirty joke which I shall not repeat in this dispatch. I must admit I was impressed. I asked Balyn what his trade was -- I had suspected from the roughness of his face that he was a farmer, and I was correct. I shall be visiting farms in his area outside the town tomorrow morning. We shall see if he declares income from his guar.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nA seasonal tax record from the following year lists Balyn's trade as \"farmer\", but also includes a note of \"secondary income -- street performer / other\". Indeed, only about 60% of Balyn's income seems to have come from farming in that year. It is then safe to conclude that there is some degree of truth to this story.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThere was indeed a Dunmer named Balyn Omathan with a guar that seemed to be able to speak, and he profited modestly from this talent for several years. This is the first evidence that I have seen which proves there is any shred of truth to the story at all, and yet it comes so tantalizingly close to an explanation without clarifying anything. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHow did this creature speak?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHow did it learn to say the things that it is alleged to have said?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDid it think for itself, or was it trained to simply replicate the sounds of speech?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThese are questions which shall likely forever perplex me. We now know that Mudfoot the guar did indeed speak -- but the question of how and why he spoke shall most probably always a mystery remain.<BR>","data":{"weight":2.5,"value":100,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
