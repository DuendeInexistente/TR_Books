Indeed, the proud residents of this jewel upon the Inner Sea often attribute the city's commercial prosperity to the blessing of Almalexia and her great deeds here. So long as the Temple stands upon her isle, it is said, Bal Foyen will never fall to ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nTholer Andas, councilor of Great House Hlaalu, rules Bal Foyen from his grand estate overlooking the city. Beneath his lofty perch lies Warden Plaza, so named for Almalexia's war-aspect and in reverence for the peace that has endured under her rule. This part of Bal Foyen is home to the city's Fighters and Mages Guilds, as well as the local Council Manor of House Hlaalu. A traveler seeking rest may find it in the Dancing Cup Inn, while those in town to browse Bal Foyen's famous markets will find no shortage of bargains in Warden Plaza's shops. The renowned Port of Bal Foyen can be found just north of the plaza, its docks and warehouses buzzing perpetually with activity as goods depart and arrive from a score of foreign cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern Bal Foyen -- what remains of its ancient core -- is today called the Old Town. Here, Dunmer live and work much as they have for a thousand years, producing goods no less fine than their expatriate competitors in Warden Plaza. The Old Town hosts many such businesses, as well as the city's Morag Tong hall. Visitors affiliated with House Hlaalu are advised to inquire at the Golden Moons Club, an establishment of fine repute and well-mannered staff. Less well-to-do arrivals to the Old Town would do well to watch their pocketbooks when staying at the Council Club. Adjacent to the Old Town is the Manor District, a Third Era neighborhood whose residents -- notables of the highest order -- live in luxurious fashion in resplendent manors, each with its own character. The Imperial Commission can also be found here, led by the redoubtable magistrate Janonia Melitus and Agronak gro-Dumag, commander of the local Imperial Legion garrison. A chapel dedicated to Mara offers services to the Imperial cult devotees and other visitors alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the center of the city's districts lies the Temple Isle. When Almalexia defeated the armies of the invading Akaviri at the ancient village that once stood at this site, the ground first collapsed, then rose again in the center of the crater, forming the island that today hosts one of the most important temples of the Tribunal faith. The largest bridge on Temple Isle leads to the picturesque waterfalls that cascade down the city's cliffs, and to the famous Shrine of Almalexia's Fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\\r\\nRegion Information\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nBal Foyen lies in the Roth Roryn region, at the northwesternmost corner of Mournhold District. The crags and hills south and west of the city make overland travel difficult on foot, but silt striders pass over these obstacles with relative ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoth Roryn\\r\\n\\r\\nRoth Roryn is a vast, rocky region of pale red stone, hostile wildlife, and tough, hardy plants. Long considered a borderland between the Great Houses Redoran and Indoril, in recent centuries much of the Roryn has come to be dominated by the ascendant Great House Hlaalu. Although House Indoril has retreated east of the river Thirr and abandoned Roth Roryn, Redoran forces still garrison key outposts in this part of Resdayn, especially the approaches to the city of Veranis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constellation of small settlements to Bal Foyen's south and east are mostly agricultural in nature -- the plantation economy of Aanthirin extends even into these harsh badlands. Further west, though, the towns of Omaynis and Menaan scrape a hard living from the rocks themselves and from the trade of passing caravans. Across the Pryai River (which the Hlaalu have long sought to establish as the boundary of their control in the region), the great Monastery of Saint Felms stands astride the river's famous oxbow bend.\\r\\n<BR><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><IMG SRC=\"tr\\bal_foyen_region_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"377\" HEIGHT=\"189\"><DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":3,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
