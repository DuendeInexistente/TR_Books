I have faced horrors that would make the souls of men scream. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI have cracked the bones of heretics and withstood their assault on my purity and on my mortal flesh. I feel the scars on my body and spirit. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI have burned the unholy in the cleansing fire of the Tribunal. Their tormented screams almost drowned out the song of Vivec in my heart. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI have held the broken bodies of my comrades. Each drop of blood from their wounds were molten rocks on my soul; first searing and then hardening, until naught but stone remains. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI feel the loss of my crippled arm in the same way as I feel the gaping maw in my soul. My body yearns to be whole once more. My soul longs for the return of its youth, the time when I still possessed compassion and kindness. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBut, I regret nothing. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo face terror and not lose belief is a test of faith.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo triumph over evil brings honor to the Order.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo overcome weakness in the self gives strength to the soul.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo feel loss and to persevere is to move closer to transcendence.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo give of body and of soul for the glory of the Tribunal is the greatest honor of all. \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAll I regret is having but one life to give for ALMSIVI.<BR>",
