Looking for a place to forget the troubles of the road? Fret not, the Bellman has you covered! Our correspondents have visited, rated, and ranked all our taverns, inns and boarding houses, for your convenience.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nThe Moth and Tiger<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nDespite its unassuming exterior, this establishment offers the finest lodgings and drinks in all of Ebonheart. Do try its impressive selection of wines. Travelers longing for the comforts of home need look no further than the first building to the right as they enter our city through the main gate. Not to be confused with the Legion Boarding House across the street, which only serves Legion recruits, poorly.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nThe Mother Alessia<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nOur city's best bakery is located at the intersection just past the Moth and Tiger. While it offers no lodgings or drinks, it makes up for this with the quality of its baked goods. The Mother Alessia is well-renowned for its biscuits, specialty bread, and pies. Indeed, it is said that the unsurpassed quality of the Mother Alessia is the reason why so many bakers find their way to our city, eager to sample its wares and glean its recipes.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nThe Empress Katariah<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nThe oldest of our city's taverns, this establishment's beds are acceptable, its food serviceable, and its drinks cheap. While the building has seen better days, it is worth a visit for its colourful clientele. Strike up a conversation with its regulars, and you are bound to have an interesting time. Its bartender, on the other hand, is far less talkative, which ensures that patrons' secrets will not be spilled by the serving staff.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nHostel of Stendarr's Mercy<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nWhile those new to our city might be misled by the name, the Hostel of Stendarr's Mercy does not serve common travelers. Instead it is dedicated to the rehabilitation of those citizens unfortunate enough to have found themselves enslaved by the Dark Elves. Those of means and generous spirit may nevertheless wish to visit the hostel on Craftsmen Street to leave a donation and allow the good work to continue.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nThe Salty Futtocks<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nLocated on the eastern side of the city, this establishment has little to offer to well-off travelers. Worse, it is notorious for its watered-down liquor and frequent bar brawls. Adventurous travelers looking for a good time might feel tempted to pay the place a visit, but be warned: you are just as likely to find a knife to the back, instead. Surely the guards would have shut the tavern down long ago, were it not for the diversion it offers the dregs of society.<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nSix Fishes<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nShould you find yourself in Ebonheart-on-Vvardenfell, the Six Fishes offers rooms and interesting drinking companions to any traveler. While the inn is not particularly exceptional, its visitors are varied and have many a tale to tell about the hazards of the island. For the adventurous traveler, a visit should prove instructional, but those that prefer more refined comforts would do well to stay on the mainland.<br><br>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
