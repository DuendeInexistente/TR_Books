When the lordly armies of Nerevar marched towards the wicked towers upon Red Mountain, they stopped at Black Gate, citadel of the Shining Star. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nLordly Nerevar ascended the great steps of the fortress and prayed before the high priest Delyn, seeking wisdom and counsel from the mouth of the Gods. \"Wise Delyn, whence do I go?\" <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nThe great Delyn lifted his head, listening to the winds and the tremors of the earth. \"You go to glory, herald of the Coming Dawn. Go forth, son of Boethiah.\" Delyn turned to Alandro Sul, shield-bearer of the mighty lord. \"Go forth, son of Azura. In eleven days the Chimer of Resdayn shall rejoice.\" As Nerevar marched on, Delyn wept grievously, for he had foreseen that lord's death. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nSo it came to pass that the legions of Indoril and Redoran assaulted Red Mountain and the treacherous Sharmat and traitorous Dwemer felled many, including General Nerevar. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nYet in seclusion, Delyn could see and hear all. In the depths of sleep, Lady Azura approached. \"Why do you weep, Delyn? Resdayn has brought the Dwemer to naught. If you should weep, mourn the loss. Do you not wish to see and rejoice with them?\" <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nDelyn, exhausted and languid from fasting, looked up to the Lady Azura with eyes filled with tears of blood. \"Rejoice? Has this always been your way, Mother Soul? You guided great Veloth from the kingdoms of the ancestors. You showed him the path to Morrowind, yet how much can you claim as your own, Lady Moonshadow? Did you suffer pangs of grief for our sons and daughters waylaid in the lands of the Wild Ones? Did you weep as your children were burned as torches and mangled for pleasure by the savage kings Nilichi and Hadhuul? What solace have you offered your people, Azura? Moonshadow may be the summit of beauty, but your hand has made these lands an altar of blood and sacrifice. I do not weep for our loss. I weep for you. I can no longer praise your name with my tongue and curse it with my heart.\"<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nLady Azura stood up from the bedside and from that place grew roses and lilies. She grew rigid, withdrawing her hands as though stung by his coldness. \"Have I not lost a son this night? Does my son Alandro mean nothing? I created him with mine own hands, yet he lies among the ash of Red Mountain. Is my suffering not enough for Resdayn?\" <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nDelyn looked up from his bed, \"Alandro Sul is not your son. He is the son of Resdayn. Did you raise him with your own hands? Did you place him to your pap? Your priests and priestesses raised him from birth. Do not claim that which you do not deign to love. Do not claim the Chimer as your most cherished, for you have sat idle when we needed you most. Your glory and awe could have ended this war with a simple glance, yet now Lord Nerevar and many sons and daughters are dead. They are your last offering, Azura. We both sit upon the summit of Black Gate, the darkened star. Your powers are diminished here, Moonshadow. Your servants will abandon and forget you. You have betrayed yourself, Azura. You are but the predecessor. You are the anticipation of a nobler lord. ALMSIVI is coming! May Resdayn praise this day, for your machinations are at an end.\" <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nAzura closed her eyes, and withdrew to the rosy shadows of her realm. Delyn stood up from his bed, and opened the shutters of the fortress. The morning light filled the land but did not fall upon the citadel. <BR> \r\n<BR>\r\nEleven hours passed; scrib gathered about the temple. From the northern horizon, a glimmer was seen unlike anything before. Delyn rose from the steps of Black Gate and praised the victorious legions, yet no legion of golden armor was seen. A single figure stood upon the horizon, glimmering like a spire of all things precious. Delyn fell upon his knees as the figure approached, for he knew the face of this mer. \"Have I not seen your face, my child? Are you not the last of fallen Sotha? Are you he whom I seek? Are you Azura reborn?\"<BR> \r\n<BR>\r\n\"Your faith has brought me here, Delyn, wisest of mystics. Your prayers have been heard. Behold.\" With a single breath, the darkness that shadowed the temple and citadel was banished and the glorious light, illuminating from the body of a single mer filled the lands. \"Rise up, beloved teacher of mer. You are my prophet, for We am ALMSIVI.\" Seht placed his hand upon the shoulder of the aged Delyn and in that moment Delyn's robes shimmered like fire and ice. \"Beloved son, you are one of many. Go forth from this place where God has walked and teach my people. The promise of Azura is reborn in me. I give you power over all things that they may be instruments of illumination.\" <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDelyn's eyes were filled with bright rays. He closed them for but a moment and after mighty Seht was gone. \"Praised be the name of ALMSIVI. Let all Resdayn rejoice, for a new lord has come to redeem our people!\" <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDelyn gathered his things and hastened to teach the people of the new age of ALMSIVI. He did not turn back, but instead asked the scrib to conceal the dark blemish of Azura from the light of day. The scrib piled stones upon the citadel and hid it in the darkness, as was its namesake. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFor many centuries, Delyn preached the lessons of Vehk and the beloved teachings of Ayem and Seht. He guided House Indoril towards a glorious rebirth and authored many books concerning the glory of ALMSIVI. In his last days, Delyn took a pilgrimage to Sotha Sil and prayed at the temple. He died on his way to Necrom to pray beside the tomb of Saint Nerevar.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":50,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
