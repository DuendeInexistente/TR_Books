It is somewhat known that the criminal underworld of the Hlaalu capital, once kept only in the rational, native hands of the Camonna Tong, has since become oversaturated, and something of a tug of war between the Tong, the Empire's Thieves Guild, and the newly established Ja-Natta Syndicate, infamous for its new drug \"Greydust\". Whatever shadowy organisation could have gone to such drastic measures, however, is currently unknown.<BR><BR>\r\n\"It's terrifying to think that such violence happened right beneath my feet -- that it can happen at any time,\" says one merchant at the Grand Bazaar.<BR><BR>\r\nRest assured dear readers, that as long as you hold yourself in esteem and stay on the right side of the law, you have no reason to fear petty criminals -- we can all trust that the dedicated guards of the Canyon Watch shall protect us from all injustice.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
