After he drove the invaders out of the Tear region, they set sail across what was then called Oroynyon Bay and attacked the fortress of Aronun, over which now sits Ald'Oronis.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this day the northern coast of Oroynyon Bay was controlled by two very close houses, House Dreynyon and House Oronis. The former controlled most of the area, though the latter had control of the peninsula southeast of Mt. St. Delyn. During the attack on Aronun, nearly all of the Oronis family was wiped out. Though there may have been more survivors, the only recorded ones were Oronis Mesa, the daughter of the Oronis grandmaster, and her nephew and niece Oronis Elim and Gali. During their refuge in Dreynyon Vale, Oronis Mesa married the leader of House Dreynyon, Dreynyon Olim. Sometime in the early years of their marriage, they decided to unite their two families into one. From this union House Oroynyon was formed.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, during the Battle of Red Mountain, the Oroynyons gained great fame and wealth. Oroynyon Elim, now head of House Oroynyon, gained a particularly large amount of money by selling a few unique dwemer artifacts. He is even believed to have been in Dagoth Ur during the disappearance of the Dwemer, though he was certainly not in the Chamber of Lorkhan's Heart.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the history of the Dunmer, the Oroynyons continued to grow strong. They quickly built many different homes around Oroynyon Bay. These included the rebuilding of Aronun as Ald'Oronis, the Oroynyon Plantation, Alt'Oroynyon, and Oroynyon Vale. This glorious house was even present during the founding of Bosmora, and once controlled nearly as far west as Old Keep.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThey faced only one fall after the sacking of Aronun. During the exile of the Boethian Dualistics, one group of Oroynyons, led by Oroynyon Resim, abandoned the house and went with these cultists. Not only did the take nearly a fifth of their members, money, and power, this caused a great rift within the remaining members. There was such a fight over this abandonment, filled with placing of blame and accusations, that many of the westerners left. The city of Oroynyon'ruhn was controlled by some of these rebels, and it was renamed Methren'ruhn, after their new surname.<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this great schism, Minor House Oroynyon remains strong. They are nearly in complete control of southeastern Indoril, and remain on great terms with all other Great Houses, particularly House Dres. They are strong supporters of the Temple, and recognize the Imperials as a necessary presence in what is now Morrowind. Let us hope that this excellent family continues in its strength forever! <BR>","data":{"weight":1.0,"value":20,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
