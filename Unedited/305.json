In order to use less magicka and gain longer periods of conjuration time, there have been proposals on how to properly fluctuate the mana stream to certain threads, such as from Magnus to Aetherius' second plane or through Secunda to the Void Itself. However, magicka redirection is an extremely complex subject and but a few wizards have ever claimed to accomplish this, most notably Amion of Crystal Tower, but with him drifting into madness after living eight hundred years and not eager to teach, the mystery will remain. I was one of the few living Mer to see him perform the conjuration of Frost Atronach with a simple gesture and no mantras at all.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAs we all know, all common mages have to rely on the usual method of the customary mantra 'Web-Oht-Ekem Yoodt-Payem-Oht-Neht Yahkem-Oht-Yoodt' or a slight variation of it, and the hand gesture of symmetrically aligning three first fingers not to any sphere of Daedra gods. A common point to focus one's attention is the sun, as it is the direct link to the source of magicka itself and thus neutral. Some disagree, though, but Magnus has been proven to be the most powerful of all points in the firmament.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhen I finally took the chances of actually testing the redirection procedures, the results did not prove to be as successful as I first thought. Firstly a test environment was needed, so unnecessary deaths would be avoided. I chose to put a kwama forager in a lair with a traditionally summoned Frost Atronach. Being an aggressive beast as it is, the kwama chose to defend itself from the freezing cold elemental, dying swiftly in the attempt. Yet, the Atronach itself showed no signs of aggression against such a beast until attacked. The summoning of an atronach is considered an offensive act for the atronach will engage on any enemy of the caster, with no regards to its own fate. The question remains, though, how does a summoned Daedra detect these aggressors and could the detection be made more effective, perhaps to the level of thoughts themselves?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOn a continued experiment, I was to stream the magicka not make the atronach's physical appearance visible, but to render only its actions obvious for any dweller of Nirn. This would not be done by an invisibility spell that hides already visible matter, there is a major difference between these two. However, the test failed as the actions of the atronach were bound between Oblivion and Nirn, not reaching either one. I have not been able to find studies on this subject and doubt there even are any.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnother thing to consider was to lessen the amount of cold energy a Frost Atronach releases while being summoned. It seemed that even peaceful critters would either escape or attack when being caught by this small but noticeable field. Unnecessary energy should be either surged to other, more needed attributes or reserved to another purpose later. It might not be much, but as it is gradually building up, summoning three Atronach a day without this effect would be noticeable in the magicka surroundings.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOn repeated experiments with a kwama being near to a frost atronach and redirecting the flow from the Elvyr field, as I shall call it, to the Void itself, pleasant results were finally achieved. The kwama did not, in fact, pay no attention to the atronach although it was clearly visible. This called for testing with diseased rats, who were far more eager to attack it, although still a bit hesitant. It seems that for kwama, the only way to detect an odorless elemental is its surrounding heat field, or motion, a Storm Atronach's defining feature. On one thing uncertainty bothers me, though - does the said flow method actually apply to all spellcasters, or does it require a connection with the Void only formed by fierce practice? <BR>",
