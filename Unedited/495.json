LET all the finite worlds of the Kalpa bear witness to the majesty of Shor.\r\n<BR>\r\nII. There were many mighty battles in this war of first death. Shor marshalled the young Heroes of the old World, the veterans of Sovngarde, and led Them in great deeds. Tsun's berserks, Stuhn's slavers, Kyne's tongues, Mara's hearth-guards. But for all Their murderous fury, the numbers of the pallid elves were beyond counting.\r\n<BR>\r\nIII. And so, despite every crushing victory of the Hersir, the Children died. If Tsun mauled them in the East, the Children died. If Stuhn captured them in the West, the Children died. If Kyne rent them from the North, the Children died. The tears of Mara's love ran South and drowned the host, and still the Children died.\r\n<BR>\r\nIV. The Heart of Shor is not dead, wherever It may be, and He does not bear the suffering of His Children. And so did Shor, most cunning Father to all, devise a scheme to save the Clan of the Hirser.\r\n<BR>\r\nV. Mighty Shor stepped forward and stood tall, across from the damned army of elves, who capered in terror at His appearance. His brow was shrouded with moribund fire, His shoulders were His resplendent Shield-Thanes, His breast was filled to bursting with His Heart. He will be elf-death made manifest.\r\n<BR>\r\nVI. And the elf-host did fall upon Him, and the demons tore at Him, and though He slew twice their infinite number they still numbered three infinities. So it was that the demon king, whose form is a mocking likeness of ALDUIN, pierced and stole the Heart of Shor.\r\n<BR>\r\nVII. The king of demons is fashioned in a mockery of ALDUIN, for even the form of elf-demons is a blasphemy. The body of a dragon, he has, but in an ever spinning wheel, devouring himself and debasing himself with thoughts of deathlessness. The eternal and infinite is a grotesque delusion.\r\n<BR>\r\nVIII. And the demon king, whose form is mocking likeness of ALDUIN, raised the lifeless and broken body of Shor upon his standard. The Wives of Shor saw this with a wail, and screamed, and covered Themselves with songs of mourning. The Children beat Their shields and howled and knew sorrow for the first time. The grief of Shor's Clan echoed through the Kalpa.\r\n<BR>\r\nIX. But the elves and their demons are ugly and debased, and upon seeing the Heart were themselves pierced with shame. The demon king (whose form is a mocking likeness of ALDUIN) could not destroy the Heart and so hid it from World. As one, the host fled.\r\n<BR>\r\nX. Such was Shor's cunning scheme. For with His death He cursed the demons and their elves, that their lives would be of shame, and terror, and frailty. And He spoke to His Wives, that They would maintain the slumber of ALDUIN, for He knew that the elves would sooner hasten the World's ending than suffer the shame of their existence any longer.\r\n<BR>\r\nXI. Thus did the spirit of Shor the Father depart the World, with His death preserving a little longer all Its intricate goodness.\r\n<BR>\r\nMeditate on this: Death comes even for Gods. What value, then, has forbearance?<BR><BR>\r\n","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":300,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
