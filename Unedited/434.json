To aid those of poor memory, I have recorded some alchemical formulae which use the native flora.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPotions to restore fatigue are amongst the easiest to produce, if only because the required ingredients are so abundant across Tamriel. Many common foodstuffs possess the required effect; combining two or more of them in a set of quality alchemical apparatus results in a more potent -- and bottleable -- extract. Bread, apple, cheese, honey, leek and potato are all easy to obtain throughout the Holds. Bread in Skyrim is baked in the Colovian fashion, from native witherwheat flour. The grains and flour also restore fatigue, but are much less palatable. Apples can be found on their trees, and are often farmed, as are leeks and potatoes. Honey can be obtained from beehives, which are normally cultivated on farms and in some cities.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTo create a potion for the restoration of health, combine black spore cap and honey lily blossom. The black spore mushroom can be found in dark and damp places across Skyrim, though only its cap is of alchemical interest; the stalk tastes bitter and is good for little. Honey lily flowers grow in abundance across the Reach, and particularly in Midkarth. The plants are easy to find -- they have tall stalks, and their blossom is the distinctive honey color for which the plant is named.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nVarious diseases spread by the secretion of the native Wormmouth can be cured by combined application of Vicar Herb leaves and Aspyr Tea. The Vicar Herb is a common plant throughout the Reach, resembling a tiny tree with flowers white as stars. The Aspyr Tea is cultivated by Reachmen farmers, but may be found growing wild in the Sundered Hills or the Druadach Highlands.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOf particular interest to adventurers is a potion to lessen one's weight. This is simply prepared by adding equal parts Cloudy Corn to Shadowfly stalk. Cloudy Corn is a farmed staple food across the province, but the Shadowfly plant is quite rare, and only grows in the wilds of Skyrim. Anyone who spots its purple petals whilst travelling should take care to harvest the plant, as they are of value to practising alchemists. When combined with the flower of the Taragetis the Shadow Fly will render a potion for the replenishment of one's magicka.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAn extract to aid exploration in dark places can be distilled from crushed shadowfly stalk and the root of the forsythia tromja. The forsythia is a tough and dark shrub with sparse golden flowers, though its most useful part lies under the ground. The roots are surprisingly thin and wiry, though should never be eaten raw, as they contain a mild paralyzing poison. The use of an alembic is highly recommended.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":150,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
