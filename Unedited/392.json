When we last saw Eslaf, he was a boy, an orphan, a failed beggar, running through the wild winter woods of \r\r\nSkyrim, away from his home of Erolgard. He continued running, stopping here and there, for many more years, until he was a young man.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEslaf discovered that among the ways of getting food, asking for it was the most troublesome. Far easier was finding it in the wilderness, or taking it \r\r\nfrom unguarded market stalls. The only thing worse than begging to get food was begging for the opportunity to work for the money to buy it. That seemed \r\r\nneedlessly complicated.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNo, as far as Eslaf was concerned, he was best off being a scavenger, a beggar, and a thief.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe commited his first act of thievery shortly after leaving Erolgard, while in the southern woods of Tamburkar in the rugged land near Mount Jensen just \r\r\neast of the village of Hoarbeld. Eslaf was starving, having not eaten anything but a rather scrawny raw squirrel in four days, and he smelled meat cooking \r\r\nand then found the smoke. A band of minstral bards was making camp. He watched them from the bushes as they cooked, and joked, and flirted, and sang.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe could've asked them for some food, but so many others had refused him before. Instead, he rushed out, grabbed a piece of meat from the fire, and wincing \r\r\nfrom the burns, scrambled up the nearest tree to devour it while the bards stood under him and laughed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'What is your next move, thief?' giggled a fair, red-headed woman who was covered with tattoos. 'How do you intend to disappear without us catching and \r\r\npunishing you?'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs the hunger subsided, Eslaf realized she was right. The only way to get out of the tree without falling in their midst was to take the branch down to \r\r\nwhere it hung over a creek. It was a drop off a cliff of about fifty feet. That seemed like the wisest strategy, so Eslaf began crawling in that \r\r\ndirection.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'You do know how to fall, boy?' called out a young Khajiiti, but a few years older than Eslaf, thin but muscular, graceful in his slightest movements. 'If \r\r\nyou don't, you should just climb down here and take what's coming to you. It's idiotic to break your neck, when we'd just give you some bruises and send \r\r\nyou on your way.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'Of course I know how to fall,' Eslaf called back, but he didn't. He just thought the trick of falling was to have nothing underneath you, and let nature \r\r\ntake its course. But fifty feet up, when you're looking down, is enough to give anyone pause.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n'I'm sorry to doubt your abilities, Master Thief,' said the Khajiiti, grinning. 'Obviously you know to fall feet first with your body straight but loose to \r\r\navoid cracking like an egg. It seems you are destined to escape us.'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEslaf wisely followed the Khajiiti's hints, and leapt into the river, falling without much grace but without hurting himself. In the years that followed, \r\r\nhe had to make several more drops from even greater heights, usually after a theft, sometimes without water beneath him, and he improved the basic \r\r\ntechnique.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen he arrived in the western town of Jallenheim on the morning of his twenty-first birthday, it didn't take him long to find out who was the richest \r\r\nperson, most deserving of being burgled. An impregnable palace in a park near the center of town was owned by a mysterious young man named Suoibud. Eslaf \r\r\nwasted no time in finding the palace and watching it. A fortified palace he had come to learn was like a person, with quirks and habits beneath its hard \r\r\nshell.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was not an old place, evidently whatever money this Suoibud had come into was fairly recent. It was regularly patrolled by guards, implying that the \r\r\nrich man was fearful of been burgled, with good reason. The most distinctive feature of the palace was its tower, rising a hundred feet above the stone \r\r\nwalls, doubtless giving the occupant a good defensive view. Eslaf guessed that that if Suoibud was as paranoid as he guessed him to be, the tower would \r\r\nalso provide a view of the palace storehouse. The rich man would want to keep an eye on his fortune. That meant that the loot couldn't be directly beneath \r\r\nthe tower, but somewhere in the courtyard within the walls.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe light in the tower shone all night long, so Eslaf boldly decided that the best time to burgle was by the light of day, when Suoibud must sleep. That \r\r\nwould be the time the guards would least expect a thief to pounce.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd so, when the noon sun was shining over the palace, Eslaf quickly scaled the wall near the front gate and waited, hidden in the crenelations. The \r\r\ninterior courtyard was plain and desolate, with few places to hide, but he saw that there were two wells. One the guards used from time to time to draw up \r\r\nwater and slake their thirst, but Eslaf noticed that guards would pass by the other well, never using it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHe waited until the guards were distracted, just for a second, by the arrival of a merchant in a wagon, bearing goods for the palace. While they were \r\r\nsearching his wagon, Eslaf leapt, elegantly, feet first, from the wall into the well.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was not a particularly soft landing for, as Eslaf had guessed, the well was not full of water, but gold. Still, he knew how to roll after a fall, and he \r\r\ndidn't hurt himself. In the dank subterranean storehouse, he stuffed his pockets with gold and was about to go to the door which he assumed would lead to \r\r\nthe tower when he noticed a gem the size of an apple, worth more than all the gold that was left. Eslaf found room for it down his pants.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe door did indeed lead to the tower, and Eslaf followed its curving stairwell up, walking quietly but quickly. At the top, he found the master of the \r\r\npalace's private quarters, ornate and cold, with invaluable artwork and decorative swords and shields on the walls. Eslaf assumed the snoring lump under \r\r\nthe sheets was Suoibud, but he didn't investigate too closely. He crept to the windows and looked out.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt was going to be a difficult fall, for certes. He needed to jump from the tower, past the walls, and hit the tree on the other side. The tree branches \r\r\nwould hurt, but they would break his fall, and there was a pile of hay he had left under the tree to prevent further injury.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEslaf was about to leap when the occupant of the room woke up with a start, yelling, 'My gem!'<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEslaf and stared at him for a second, wide-eyed. They looked alike. Not surprising, since they were brothers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book Warrior.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":240,"book_type":"Book","skill":"Alteration","enchantment":0}}
