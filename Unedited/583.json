This child would grow from a tumultuous childhood to become the greatest hope of all Morrowind. King Hlaalu Helseth is the firstborn child of Symmachus, former king of Morrowind and Barenziah, the former queen of Wayrest. Now that Helseth has returned to fill the empty throne of Morrowind in the wake of old King Hlaalu Llethan's tragic death, the homeland of the Dunmer has a bright future indeed.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nKing Helseth's early childhood in Mournhold was idyllic. He grew up with the best tutors that Morrowind could provide, and quickly showed an aptitude for intellectual pursuits and complex stratagems. Always a confident child, he impressed all with his youthful precociousness and courtly air. In the year 3E384, a young sister to Helseth was born to Duke Symmachus and Queen Barenziah. The new child was named Morgiah, and she showed a sweet disposition from the very first day.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe two children spent much time together when Helseth wasn't occupied with his studies. They showed a natural affinity, and rarely bickered. Where Morgiah was sweetness and light, Helseth was studious and serious. However, when Helseth was thirteen events in Cyrodiil threatened to sweep away the first family of Morrowind. The traitor Jagar Tharn had imprisoned the true emperor and taken his form. Wars broke out over all of Tamriel, and most serious of all, a revolt began in Morrowind. Queen Barenziah and her children traveled to the Imperial City to beg the false emperor to intervene. In her absence, Duke Symmachus was murdered by a mob in Mournhold, and the province of Morrowind descended into chaos.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBarenziah sheltered the children from the knowledge of their father's death for as long as she could, but the time came when they could be protected no longer. Helseth took the news well and vowed that he would not befall the same fate as his father. Barenziah deduced that the emperor sitting on the throne was in fact an imposter, through her impressive knowledge of the school of illusion. King Eadwyre had also traveled to the Imperial City for assistance and quickly reached the same conclusion regarding the emperor. Together he and Barenziah worked secretly to unmask the traitor Jagar Tharn. Helseth at this time continued his lessons and learnt the magic arts from the best teachers the Imperial City Mages Guild could provide. His interest, however, remained in alchemy, teasing hidden properties from ingredients sourced from the far corners of Tamriel.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHlaalu Llethan was announced as King of Morrowind with the approval of the holy Tribunal, and managed to restore peace to the province. Not dynamic, rousing, or especially imaginative, Llethan was nevertheless able to use his measure of popularity to unite the divisive elements in Morrowind. However, the province remained in need of a strong royal figure in the mould of Symmachus.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAfter the restoration of the rightful emperor, Barenziah had no wish to return to Mournhold, the death of her loyal husband hanging like a cloud over the great city. She was wed to the widowed King Eadwyre and moved to Wayrest to become queen, renouncing the throne of Morrowind. Helseth and Morgiah moved with their mother to Wayrest. Eadwyre had one daughter from his previous marriage, Princess Elysana. Thus Helseth became a prince of Wayrest and an heir to the throne of this most prosperous of nations in the Iliac Bay.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHelseth's time in Wayrest was a happy one for the young mer. He did everything possible to integrate himself fully into the life of Wayrest, as many nobles were initially cautious about the Dunmer prince. He even had his elven ears trimmed to look like human ears and he made influential friends among the Elder Council, a collection of powerful nobles in Wayrest. His knowledge of alchemy and sorcery continued to develop, with some at the time accusing the Prince of machinations and politics most dark, including the poisoning of rivals. This however is plainly false, as the Prince is a scholar and gentleman, and would not stoop to such a despicable level. While in Wayrest, the young prince was temporarily linked to a number of women of Wayrest nobility, although no permanent affection developed. For Morgiah the situation was considerably different. She was most advantageously married to King Karoodil of Firsthold, the most powerful of city states in the Summerset Isles.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nUpon the death of good King Eadwyre, the Elder Council upheld the traditional laws of succession and Princess Elysana ascended the throne. It is widely believed that Barenziah and Helseth were forced to leave by Queen Elysana after a bitter succession challenge, but this is not true. Cordial relations remain between Queen Elysana and her adopted brother, the beneficent King Helseth.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBarenziah decided it was time to bring her son back to Morrowind, his ancestral homeland. They settled on an estate outside of Almalexia, after King Llethan invited them to return. Soon after this King Llethan's nominated heir passed away suddenly while on a hunting expedition on Barenziah's new estate. King Llethan never recovered from the death of his beloved protégé and passed away soon after.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nMuch politicking occurred after the death of Hlaalu Llethan, particularly between the great houses. House Indoril maintained that it was their right to name the new king and that Helseth was not eligible through his mother's renunciation of the crown. House Hlaalu was saddened by the sudden death of their king, but desperately wanted to maintain control over the figurehead position. Hlaalu Helseth negotiated energetically with the nobles of House Hlaalu and managed to secure their support in his bid for the throne. House Indoril bitterly opposed this, but was forced to give way to Hlaalu after an Imperial delegation expressed support for Helseth, the most cosmopolitan and vital of the candidates.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHelseth elected to have a swift restrained coronation, as his profile was not high among the people of Morrowind due to his long absence from the court. He has not proved lax in improving this situation however. This most generous of kings pledged himself to help restore the honor of old Morrowind through a strong independent monarchy. Those who know the king are generous in their praise and he has won grudging respect even from his opponents. Morrowind is set to win back the glory of Resdayn, with mighty King Helseth in the vanguard.<BR>","data":{"weight":1.5,"value":35,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
