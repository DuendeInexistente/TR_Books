The day was correct, the summoning true.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSlashing a smoking tear through the Veil, She, her-very-self, appeared before them, terrible and resplendent. She came arrayed in ebony darker than a moonless night, wielding a blade burning hotter than the surface of the sun. And though she wore the guise of a Dunmer warrior-queen, she towered above them like a statue carved from the Red Mountain itself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Why have you disturbed me?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSurprised, the first among them prayed:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"O Boethiah, Prince of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, we come to worship thee!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe looked down upon her followers, gathered to bear witness. Frowning she asked the first:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Tell me, you who profess to know me, how shall I know you?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAfeared he exclaimed:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Each night I pray to thee, each night I call out thy wondrous names. Surely thou must recognize the sound of my voice? Thy most devoted of believers?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe frowned and let out a long sigh, and then of a sudden he was gone, the air from her lungs dispersing him.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTurning to the second she asked:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And you? How shall I measure the worth of your existence?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStunned by the power of her voice, he bowed before her darkening visage.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe clapped her hands, and he too was gone.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo the third:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"And you, tell me, how shall I know you apart from such as were they, of whom there is no trace?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShaken and speechless from the nullifications of his brethren, he whispered:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Have mercy upon us!\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe blinked twice. Once, he was in agony. Twice, he was destroyed.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe cast a withering glance across those remaining and said:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I do not grant mercy.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd so it was with the others. She putting them to proof, they offering none.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nFinally she came to me, eyes aglow with anger, tongue wet with hate, and said:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Of all my believers, but two remain. Tell me, second-to-last, with what shall you prove your existence?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWithout hesitation I drew forth my blade and buried it in the chest of the other who stood beside me, and without fear replied:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Ask him whose blood now sprouts from my blade if I exist.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe smiled. And the gates of Oblivion opened between her teeth. Then she said:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Tell me, now-last of my followers, wherefore do you remain where the others do not?\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI retrieved my blade, and offered it up saying:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"I am alive because that one is dead. I exist because I have the will to do so. And I shall remain as long as there are signs of my handwork, such as the blood dripping from this blade.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAccepting my gift, she nodded and said:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\"Indeed.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":150,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
