In my careless youth, when the West's magic orders seemed to me restrictive and unyielding, I set off into these highlands seeking knowledge of a wilder kind.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBut the Reach is a savage place, bereft of the comforts and common faculties of home and hearth. I traveled long, weary of foot and heart, before stumbling upon my first grand discovery: a mighty elven citadel, forgotten and crumbling atop a mesa of grey stone. I explored its depths, battling strange otherwordly beasts and ferocious local creatures. In the ruin's deepest catacombs, I uncovered a trove of lost elven treasure more magnificent than anything I had set eyes upon in all my years. But I lamented disturbing such a site, and despaired at the idea that my hands should be the ones to sully its glory. So I departed in peace, and kept the secrets of the citadel to myself.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI wandered on, eventually finding myself in the company of a strange man named Ancrial. A shaman-mage of significant talent, Ancrial's view of magic was unlike anything I had learned in the stuffy guildhalls of High Rock. To Ancrial, magic was not a science to be studied in a laboratory, but a force alive within every tree and rock and cloud. I remember with distinction a spell Ancrial called \"Marrelaeth\", which when cast encased my companion in an envelope of powerful warding magic, repelling the most terrible dangers of spell and sword alike.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThese dangers became apparent to me soon after I left Ancrial's company. My sights set upon some Nordic fortress of old whose ramparts teased the edge of a faraway forest, I became distracted. Realizing my mistake too late, I stumbled headlong into the camp of a wild minotaur! Eleven feet tall and bristling with ferocity and rage, the great beast and I traded deadly blows in a brisk twilight, before I hoodwinked the brute into a misstep that sent him careening off a cliff into the valley below. I did not linger to ensure his demise.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIt was long months before I found myself in civilization again, in a sprawling trade-town called Karthwasten. Though its streetlamps and road-cobbles reminded me dimly of home, I felt no longing, at least for the great cities of the West. No, when I came back to the city, it was the wilds that called to me, bidding me set off once more into the misty ravines and craggy highlands I had so come to love.<BR>",
