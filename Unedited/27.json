The cult worships the Imperial pantheon - it is comprised of the cults that venerate the Eight Divines as well as the god-hero Tiber Septim, also known as Talos, or Ysmir. Imperial cult priests maintain shrines throughout Skyrim, where worship can be undertaken and healing can be had. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhat is the Virtuous Life? <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOur doctrines are simple. We acknowledge the divinity of the Nine, and live by the Nine Virtues -- Humility, Inspiration, Piety, Work, Compassion, Justice, Ambition, Learning, and Civility. The Emperor is the Defender of the Faith, and the Empire is the worldly working of the Divine Plan; we are loyal to the Emperor and Empire in all things.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Imperial cults look to the Nine as models for living a good and virtuous life. Each of the Nine represents different aspects of life, and how it should be lived. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe practise the Virtues by offering aid to those citizens who need or ask for it. Skyrim is a harsh and cold place, and all citizens of the Empire should help and protect one another, whether that is by offering shelter or by treating wounds from strife. Needless to say, the stronger one is, the wealthier one is, the more one bears responsibility for helping and protecting others. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nImperial cult services<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany Imperial cult locations have healing altars. You may pray at Imperial cult healing altars and receive blessings which cure common diseases, cure poisons, and restore damaged attributes. We ask only a modest fee when they are used, which helps us spread the blessings of the Nine to those less fortunate than ourselves. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOur shrines are spread throughout the Holds of Skyrim. In the Reach, look for members in Karthwasten, Taurus Hall, and Fort Tiber. In Haafinheim, shrines are to be found in the City of Solitude and Northwatch Keep. The Hold of Falkreath offers cult facilities in the City of Falkreath and Neugrad Watch. Further Imperial cult locations are found in Whiterun, Helgen, Winterhold, Fort Kastav, Windhelm, Fort Mistwatch, Riften, and Greenwall. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHow do the Imperial cults view the other factions of Skyrim? <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Imperial cults have a very close relationship with the Imperial legions, and a friendly and supportive relationship with the Imperial Guilds -- especially the Fighters' and Mages' Guilds. We cannot condone the actions of the Thieves Guild, but we praise their faithful dedication to the Emperor and to Imperial culture.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe have only respect for the members of the Imperial College of the Voice, who aim to further the goals of the Empire through their training. We also respect the members of the College of Winterhold, whose research and study into the magickal arts are to the benefit of all, when disseminated freely.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe cult praises the faith of those who tend the Nordic sanctuaries throughout Skyrim, sacred places dedicated to members of the native Nordic pantheon. Many of those venerated are in common with those done so by the Cult. Whilst it is true the relationship between followers of the sanctuaries and the cult has been difficult in the past, we honor their commitment and do not wish for enmity to continue.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe decry in the strongest possible terms the actions of local rebellions. The Horme's false claim against the Septim line is an attack on Emperor and Empire, and so directly acts against the cult. Likewise, some hostile Breton tribes native to the Reach have conducted violence against Imperial holdings in Skyrim, and we can in no way approve of their actions.<BR>\r\n<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":30,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
