God-heroes come from Colovia, descending from the hills clad in golden armor, wielding shining weapons and words of power. But these Gods do not return to their cradle -- they remain in the east, in the cities that boil with wealth and fever, becoming part of them in time.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThose Gods that are born in the east, meanwhile, do not venture into the Highlands, but journey to the markets of the shining western sea, or to the holy halls of Sancre Tor, their paths deflecting from the windswept summits by the invisible pull of treasure and faith.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSeasons follow one another, as do the lives of peasants, hunters, charcoal burners, miners and shepherds. They live today as they did four thousand years ago, their faith bound up in a grim vision of the distant Divines and their butchering Founder-Saints.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Colovian Highlands remain void of faith, reason, madness or sanity. The Empire, ever present in all Imperial concerns, is to them but a shadow of a great and distant power, one that cannot be touched or observed, which barely acknowledges these lands, and is known to them only by the terrible tremors of its laws and impositions.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn the east, our Gods wage war at night, defeating demons, shining the light of law and order upon the dark corners of the world. In the west, Gods sit on cold thrones in contemplation, or they depart in conquest of distant lands.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSuch Gods as ours do not come to the Highlands, for in those unbidden places evil is not bound within a hostile spirit, but is anchored within the nature of the earth itself, eternally present within an unchanging world where the idea of order is as incomprehensible as the idea of chaos. Thus it has always been, and will remain as long as Akatosh reigns eternal over the darkened wheel of this world.<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":70,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
