  "text": "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\\r\\nA Brief Biography of Arkhonius Lim<BR>\\r\\nby Ormellia Lim\\r\\n<BR><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nIn 859, during the late bloody years of the Second Era, Arkhonius Lim was born to a lesser noble family in Nibenay. At a young age, he decided to leave his responsibilities behind and join the Guild of Mages, much to the displeasure of his father, Albinus. But economic circumstances conspired against Albinus' narrowmindedness and after some years he finally had to give his blessing to Arkhonius.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAt the age of seventeen, Arkhonius happily left the trappings of nobility behind and, given a small stipend, joined the Guild in Mir Corrup. Ever quick with his wit, the young Apprentice became the delight of his fellow Guild members. A wild variety of tricks and trinkets were created directly or indirectly through his work. When he moved on after a tumultous two years and a promotion to Journeyman, many tears were shed.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHe spent his next few years traveling southern Cyrodiil, picking up secrets and wealth in spades. He gained travel companions through his noble deeds and generosity and together they withstood the many dangers of the jungles and swamps. Many travel caravans only arrived at their destinations due to Arkhonius' diligence, and countless beasts, both two-legged and otherwise, were slain to make the rivers safe.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBy his work he aided the Imperial effort in pacifying the new province of Black Marsh, and this was recognized and appreciated. He was finally promoted to Magician at the age of thirty, having made a powerful impression on the right people.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBy the age of thirty-eight, he had settled down in Cheydinhal, earned a well-deserved reputation, and risen rapidly through the ranks of the Guild. Through his travels, he had picked up several orphans of unknown parentage and was raising them as his own. Despite never marrying himself, he had turned into a pillar of the local community and more than a handful of people were quite fond of \"Uncle Arkhon\".<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHowever, Arkhonius began to feel as trapped in his life in Cheydinhal as he had been at his family's estate so long ago. Thankfully, his reputation provided a final chance at greatness: the Guild leadership, in recognition of his talents, offered Arkhonius the title of Archmagister, and charged him with establishing the Mages Guild in newly-conquered Morrowind. As the Guild had no presence in that province before the Third Era, it would take a man with great talents to establish a foothold there.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nArkhonius took to this opportunity like a fish to water and quickly agreed. After a tearful farewell, he left his family behind and made his way east, to the Dark Elven lands. On the way, a few of his old travel companions who had fallen on hard times joined with him, to act as his bodyguards until a proper command of the Order of the Lamp could be organised.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhen he arrived in Almalexia, he had little to work with but the few Guild members who had arrived just a few days earlier and an old building that had been cleared out for the Guild's use. Thankfully, wit and charm, his strongest weapons, stood by his side and he made quite an impression on the dour Dark Elves.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThrough his years as Archmagister, he personally helped uncover the secrets of several Dwemer ruins and was one of the first to catalogue the wards of Dark Elven ancestral tombs.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nUpon his umtimely passing due to an unexpected potions accident at the age of fifty-two, he could look back on a life of success and adventure. His successors were able to build on his legacy by founding new Guild halls outside of Almalexia with the goodwill he created.<BR\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSo did Arkhonius Lim, in his own way, continue the good works of Vanus Galerion.<BR><BR>\\r\\n",
