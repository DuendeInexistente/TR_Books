From Hlerynhul's humble beginnings as a ferry crossing (known as Hleryn Ferry for most of its history), the Hleryn Clan have patiently reinvested their wealth into their city and its citizens; it is now the most prosperous settlement in the Coronati region. The city's most recent public work, its inimitable bridge which soars across the Kanit-Thirr confluence was the brainchild of House Hlaalu Councillor Arven Hleryn, ancestor of current governor, Ivul Hleryn; it was built to service the road trade between the metropolis of Narsis and House Hlaalu's holdings downstream. This wise investment will pay dividends for the Hleryn Clan, and promises more growth in the future, as the city now can toll traders taking the land route.\\r\\n\\r\\nForward-looking and cosmopolitan, Hlerynhul boasts both a temple to the Tribunal and an Imperial Cult chapel dedicated to the veneration of Dibella. The construction of the chapel was spearheaded by the governor Ivul Hleryn, not because he venerates the Nine Divines himself, but because he professes a vision for a future of Morrowind where individuals of any race or creed can intermingle and cooperate for the mutual benefit of all. Imperial citizens, no matter their place of birth, can feel secure within Hlerynhul's walls, knowing they are protected by the Tribunal, the Nine Divines, and the Hleryn Clan alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Hlerynhul is also dually protected by both Hlaalu House guards, supplied by the Hleryn Clan, and the Imperial Legion, based out of Tiger Hall on the Kanit's north bank. These noble public servants work in concert to enforce Hlaalu House law. Tiger Hall provides a practical staging-point for the Legion's policing operations in the Othreleth Woods, where lawless brigands and goblin clans continue to lurk and harass the dutiful Imperial taxpayer. It is only through cooperation between Imperial and House Hlaalu authorities that these lawless elements can be subdued; nowhere is this cooperation better shown than in the Imperial Legion's operation of Tiger Hall.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><FONT COLOR=\"000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FACE=\"Magic Cards\"><BR>\\r\\nRegion Information<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><IMG SRC=\"tr\\hlerynhul_region_map.dds\" WIDTH=\"377\" HEIGHT=\"377\"><BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\nThe Coronati Basin is a fertile region which surrounds Lake Coronati and the middle bends of the Thirr River. It is largely serene, and dotted with many small holdings where diligent Velothi and immigrant outlanders alike till the soil. Travelers through the region should however be warned that its swamps, renowned for their towering fungal mangroves, can conceal various dangers. Trolls are known to flourish in these dank conditions, while the ruins of unkinder times may be only partially subsumed by the muck. The wise tourist would stick to the roads, and watch his step when striking out cross country.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpstream on the Kanit River, the Othreleth Woods are not recommended for casual travelers. While bastions of civilization exist, and roads are patrolled by House Hlaalu and Imperial Legion forces alike, the dense woods are also a favored hiding-place for outlaws and monsters. A brave traveler, well-armed and accompanied by stalwart companions, may, however, take delight in the region's colorful vistas, and bounty of potent alchemical ingredients.<BR>",
