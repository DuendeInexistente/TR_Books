They honored the true gods. They lived as nomads, moving where they wished, when they wished. They simply lived their lives in the freedom conferred by a loose polytheism. More importantly, the Daedra did not directly interfere with the ways of the people. <BR><BR>\\r\\n   The ascent of the mortal gods, however, uprooted the system and destroyed the old ways. By utilizing a position of leadership in the battle against Dagoth Ur, the Tribunes slew the savior, the victor of Red Mountain. They robbed the Heart of its powers not meant for Man or Mer, and in doing so, they conjured the Devil into this world. But, such a creation was necessary for the fledgling gods to assume control. <BR><BR>\\r\\n   They quickly established a theocratic system of control, a system which would taint every aspect of the culture of Resdayn and its people. By utilizing Dagoth Ur's existence as \"the threat,\" they wrested power from the old gods, the Daedra. The people needed tangible protectors, and through guile and deception, the \"gods\" of the Tribunal managed to assume that position. <BR><BR>\\r\\n   In order to maintain that kind of control, those reigns around the necks of the people, the Tribunal established a strict moral code of conduct and a vast theocratic hierarchy to do their wishes. Furthermore, they created groups of elite murderers, Ordinators and Armigers, to eliminate any who doubted the verity of their claims to godhood. To appear infallible, they killed. They spilled the blood of the truth-sayers to preserve their power. Finally, they performed minor feats of generosity to instill the conception that they loved and protected the people. Small donations and alms for the poor hardly make up for the crimes they commit to maintain power, but as long as they show the people only the positive aspects of their rule, they can do almost anything they choose. <BR><BR>\\r\\n   The priests themselves are not without wickedness either. By arbitrarily naming a number of saints and employing the names of the Tribunes, they robbed the commoners and Great Houses alike of their hard-earned wealth. They even force poor workers to pay for minor blessings! Blessings cannot be bought, but the Temple persists in demanding those payments. Why? They wish to preserve control through economics as well as religious rites. The allure of wealth would not be set aside from their minds either. <BR><BR>\\r\\n   What can ordinary commoners do to battle such a force? How can a man or woman hope to stand against a mighty theocracy tied to the \"Living Gods?\" Simply ignore it. The Temple's system will cease to exist if it is not supported. If the people of Morrowind ignore the monster, it will simply fade away. The people will finally be able to reassume the pure, old ways. A simple life will bring freedom to us all.<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":150,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
