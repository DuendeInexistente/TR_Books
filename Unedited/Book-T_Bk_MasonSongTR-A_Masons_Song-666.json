Born an ashlander, his view to life was very different\\r\\nfrom mine and most of the surrounding mer folk as well. Perhaps that is\\r\\nwhy he fascinated me with such a great influence.\\r\\nAlthough old and withered now, Fainissibi had once\\r\\ntraveled through all Tamriel, gathering a great many stories from the\\r\\nland's humble folk. After twenty elven years of living among commoners,\\r\\nearning one's bread by doing masonry in Imperial forts, near new-found\\r\\nore deposits, and plowing the corkbulb fields of Morrowind and Black\\r\\nMarsh, he chose to settle down in one of the most beautiful cities of\\r\\neastern Morrowind, Tear. There he still sings and entertains the visitors\\r\\nof the Crimson Cutlass tavern.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAfter many miles of traveling horseback from Alten Corimont\\r\\nto Tear, our party leader decided to make an expedition to the local\\r\\ntaverns. We, being paid by following orders, had the opportunity of\\r\\nonce again following, and perhaps saving him from a plethora of\\r\\nproblems with the authorities. We began by drinking fine sujamma in\\r\\nthe Hanging Argonian. Perhaps even too fine - Enhyn had gotten his\\r\\n\"let us conquer the Black Marsh\" drive on and promptly stated that\\r\\nif he should ever encounter a free Argonian of prosperous stature,\\r\\nthe beast be slain on the spot. After another round in the Lizard\\r\\nCarcass, a rather shady trader inn underground, our master was\\r\\nalready too lushed to think clearly, and was ready to conquer\\r\\nElsweyr too. Then we finally arrived to the Crimson Cutlass.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThere an elder Dark Elf sat, against the wall, with several\\r\\ntired journeymen 'round him on small stools. Enhyn had always been\\r\\nfond of heroic epics described and portrayed by poets who had seen\\r\\nit all, and this mer certainly had the looks. The man, whom people\\r\\naddressed as Fainissibi, sang:<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"Laying tiles for days, 'side the abundant hills of Lainlyn<BR>\\r\\nWorking with an ogre's pace, amongst others there was Barin<BR>\\r\\nA race of Redguard, strongest of the lot<BR>\\r\\nEven he could not stand the burden of the job.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOne day we were a'working on the eastern wall<BR>\\r\\nfor had our captain commanded us, \"It shall cover the glade by\\r\\nnightfall\"<BR>\\r\\nSo we toiled, toiled hard, from dusk till sunset glow<BR>\\r\\nBut as the darkness drew near, it seemed we could not finish the last row.<BR>\\r\\nThus Barin, eager and strong still, went to the captain's camp on the side of\\r\\nthe hill.<BR>\\r\\nHe climbed down from the slight spire and to the stand<BR>\\r\\nWhile descending down, he did not see the rope's other end\\r\\nand clung to it as he fell.<BR>\\r\\nRope attached to the ground and wall, freshly masoned, came crumbling\\r\\napart.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nFor his faith to see mere twenty-five times of warmth, no more<BR>\\r\\nYet from life, he knew what to expect for<BR>\\r\\nDreams of a man, and past, struck down by the eastern wall of a mine<BR>\\r\\nbuilt to last.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSo it went and the story was told on the taverns of Hammerfell<BR>\\r\\nHow a laborer was struck down hard, struck down like a spell<BR>\\r\\nThough a man of little stature, Barin was no fool<BR>\\r\\nAnd there he rests, in the pit of Lainlyn, bottomless and cruel.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nEnhyn, as expected, had gotten very furious even before the\\r\\nfourth verse and had left the tavern swinging from side to side,\\r\\napparently ending up back in the Hanging Argonian. I did not pay\\r\\nattention to him, though, being mesmerized by the story Fainissibi\\r\\nhad told and those yet to come.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nYou might wonder, why is one measly bard so fascinating\\r\\nthat he deserves to be praised in a book. It is exactly the same\\r\\nreason many others thought of Fain - why would a good-mooded\\r\\npatron want to hear a story of a laborer being grotesquely\\r\\nsplashed by a ton of bricks?<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIt has been said by many, echoed by Fain among others, that every being is worth a song, and that is why the outcast bard of Erabenimsun tribe was so remarkable and struck to me as a gentle mind amongst the stressed and bad-habited people of these days. Sometimes, stories of one's failure give meaning and faith to others. <BR>\\r\\n",
