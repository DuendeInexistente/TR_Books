A process originally meant to be spoken and taught to an apprentice. But not any apprentice of any village in mountain nor seaside was able to learn my hammer-strike, nor my aptness with the forge.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThat is why, knowing that Archei will soon whisper my final words into my weakening ears, I will leave my knowledge to Kynaree's pious subjects. Thus a successor of equal ability might join me in forging those weapons that keep Sheor's servants in their unwelcome halls, as I might join my masters in Her cloud-palace.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nForging mithril is a most challenging process to master. With improper technique, an object of mithril might be more fragile than glass and as brittle as the charcoal that was used to fire it. It requires special tools and a high quality iron that is both well malleable under heating, but rigid of construction when cool. The iron in the lower caves of the mountains has these qualities. The second major ingredient is what they call spellstones in common speech. These need to be of high purity, as any deformation in the crystal can weaken the integrity of the infusion. Crystal of highest purity can be obtained from those sites and thereunder where the druids of old performed their rites. The structure of the spellstone must ring bright and true, resonating in unison with the iron it will bond with. Failure shows the need to procure ingredients from better sources.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nNext, one needs to powder the spellstone, an intense and volatile process. One needs to crush it in a mortar with no surface imperfections, and grind it to a powder the consistency of fine sand. Magick might escape during this treatment, and one might keep it contained by hiring one proficient in the arcane arts, or by constructing a brass dome with mirrors of silver and glass. Next, one heats the metal close to white hot -- one needs a well-constructed kiln to do so -- and then one needs to work quickly. Brush the surface as to rid it of the influence of air and cold and add the spellstone to the metal, making sure to get even distribution and infusion. Fold the metal and add the spellstone to the metal eightfold in quick succession. Reheat after this process but once to near white, and draw the ply out to a desired shape to set its form. After cooling one can make the metal only red hot, to draw out the blade or plate, keeping the direction of one's previous blows. After satisfaction, quench in the salt-water of the ghostly sea, and sharpen or polish as necessary.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThese are but the fundamentals of smithing mithril. Often one needs to add patterns for the magick to flow into the desired direction, so as to strengthen the piece as a whole. This requires decades to master properly, as misdirected magicka impedes function, even though the blade might still keep its edge. This, however, cannot be conveyed in writing, and must be discovered by oneself to master it.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1500,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"Armorer","enchantment":0}}
