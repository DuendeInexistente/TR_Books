It is Sithis -- change -- without the Lorkhanic element of striving or endeavor. It is sacred, and the people of Veloth have lived in harmony with it since before there were Houses. It is the Anticipations' gift, and Almsivi's pact.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe fire is without purpose. It records no memory. It sees not, and it hears not. It strives for nothing. Yet the Velothi wield it to cook and tend and tame. With fire we have sung to this land in its own voice. With fire we have warmed hearths and shaped bone. Fire is the blood of the nation that is Resdayn.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe fire is without distinction. It knows neither friend nor foe. It awakes at its whim and sleeps at its leisure. It is dangerous. Yet the Velothi wield it in defense of our clans. It cows the outlander and destroys the marauder. Where the outlander cries at its touch, we wear it as cowl and shroud.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPractical Knowledge<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPractitioners and learned mer say that fire was shaped by the hand of Boethiah. This is because the Anticipation of Almalexia gifted to us the secret of its taming, and because the nature of fire is revolt. To sustain itself, fire requires air and magicka; without either, it dies. It is a thing of nature that must be sustained, and thus unlike water or earth, it lives. Like that which lives, an abundance of sustenance may cause it to grow beyond hope of control. The nature of fire is revolt, and so, in abundance, it overthrows.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhen fire burns, it consumes, and all that it touches is transformed. It is in most cases degenerative: Wood and papyrus are stripped to ash and smoke; flesh blackens and empties of vital essence. In moderation, however, fire's transformative properties may be honed to the benefit of the intelligent practitioner. Heated with fire, sand and clay may be refined to glass and pottery, alchemic essence may be distilled in a retort from the mundane, and beneficent vegetations such as Aloe Vera may be boiled into an innervating tea that rejuvenates mind and body. Wielded improperly, fire destroys. In the hands of the deft practitioner, it purifies.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSome elements not only react to flame, but enliven it. The proper practition of fire demands these elements be handled with caution. Alcohol, dried saltrice, and feathers of the cliff racer are three such elements. The volatile fire salt may even combust instantaneously on contact with other elements in which fire dwells uneasily. Fire petal does not yield to the flame and may be ground into a paste and dried for an insulant.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nFurther Learning<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe conjuring of flame is among the holiest of ends to which magicka can be turned. It is the dictate of the Emperor in Cyrodiil that all magical instruction be relegated to the halls of the Guild of Mages, however, and so lies beyond the scope of this codex. Nevertheless, for those who aspire to wield the gift of fire, seek the Temple and its faithful. Our knowledge of flame runs deep, for it is and always has been the birthright of we who were blessed with skin of ash.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nALMSIVI.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n",
