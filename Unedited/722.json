Man and beast blazing trail together.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nOne in nature, each relying upon the other, more than just man and beast, but equals who need one another to survive.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHow I long to run across the tundra in their mighty wake.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThat would truly be my greatest honor.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe morning would be spent gathering dyes to paint our mammoths and then carve the fiercest images into their tusks.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThen it would be time for the skeever hunt. Our clubs would rain down upon the rat pests smashing the life out of them.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIn the evening could sit around the campfire and I would regale those nearby with songs of their majesty and grace.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThey would let me sample of the mammoth's cheese. A food so foul yet with healing properties so great.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWe'd snack on the roasted skeever we'd freshly caught that day before laying under the stars to sleep.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nI'd slowly fade to dream nested in the radiating heat of mammoth fur. Its cold resisting properties keeping me snug.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhat a grand time we would have.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nUnknown<BR>\\r\\n<BR>",
