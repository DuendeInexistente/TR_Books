The new owners of the Narsis Fortuna, who mysteriously inherited it from the Camonna Tong and who wish to stay anonymous, have proposed that the incident was \"a simple but unfortunate gas leak\" and that \"these things happen.\" Yet more disturbing, this mystery gas' particular alchemical origins cannot be deciphered by Narsis' best alchemists either -- \"its substance is unlike anything ever seen -- on Tamriel anyway,\" they said.<BR><BR>\\r\\nPerhaps we, loyal citizens of Narsis and Great House Hlaalu, should simply allow the proper authorities to work and discover the cause of this tragedy, and in the meantime it would be wise for us all to mourn the unfortunate and brutal loss of a great many friends and kin in the Tong, taken from us by this strange poison.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
