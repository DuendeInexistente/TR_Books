There are many extant works that claim to be of Khajiti origins, most of them translations, but none that most scholars agree are genuine. For instance, I recently translated a book on the Hall of Colossus, but after publishing, I received numerous letters arguing about it being a forgery.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhat most agree with is that Khajiti and Imperial scribes were hired to collect the works and sayings of their race in order for the Emperor to better understand the Khajiit. This project was ultimately a failure, but it preserved much Khajiti literature that would otherwise have been lost.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThese scholars divided their work into the Books of Sand, Sugar, Meat, Rain, and Dust. The Books of Sand focus mainly on poetry, mostly of a personal nature, and nursery rhymes. The Books of Sugar are of erotic poetry and tales. The Books of Meat include maxims, parables, and children's fables. The Books of Rain are pseudo-historical or pseudo-religious in nature, but include long digressions on cooking recipes, smithing techniques, battle strategy, and other practical subjects. The Books of Dust are mystical, philosophical, and inscrutable, even to the Khajiit themselves.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSince that time more books have been added to each series, such that you can tell the relative age of Khajiti literature by the number of the book. Generally the first and second of each series predate the Third Era, while later books are of more recent origin.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThere is little interest outside Elsweyr for Khajiti literature, but there is a small market for poetry from all eras and races. I would like to thank Black Moon Publishing of Rihad for the small advance that allowed me to translate some of the most accessible sections. I would also like to thank Dro'Sharr, Fahra of Orcrest, Clan-Mother Manibi, and Ri'Haniir for their patience and assistance in understanding certain passages.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Note on the Translation<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nKhajiti poetry of the late Second Era and early Third Era tends to have little meter or structure, but many internal rhymes, assonance, and alliteration. Children's rhymes are more similar in structure to the poetry of the Empire. In a few of these translations, I endeavored to retain some of the character of the original, but Cyrodiilic's more advanced phonology makes the feel of the poetry difficult to replicate. Another consideration was that a more accurate rendition might sound dull and repetitive to a broader audience.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs Ta'agra lacks direct equivalents to the familiar Imperial pronouns and makes it difficult to refer to certain things except by name, I have used what I feel is the closest of 'one's', 'Khajiit', 'the', 'this', 'my', 'your', etc. in place of the original wording, even though this is never a perfect translation.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe original poems are untitled -- indeed, it is sometimes difficult to tell where one begins or ends -- so I have created titles myself.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour Humble Translator,<BR>\r\nCassolar Draebo<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Princes (First Book of Sand)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen the restless years come<BR>\r\npawing at your vest<BR>\r\nand the flood weather strums the fur and the skin<BR>\r\nand the blood pleasure stretches the claw-tips<BR>\r\nand the thrills of your naked pains are made grand<BR>\r\nand the sacred self spills forth<BR>\r\nlike grains of sand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen the battle drums beat<BR>\r\nas you come leaping into the fray<BR>\r\nand chance grants you great gains<BR>\r\nand the feet that prance are clay<BR>\r\nand your teeth tear the sweetest meat<BR>\r\nand the warband reaps one's foes<BR>\r\nlike grains of sand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen the prey flees<BR>\r\nwhether beast or beauty<BR>\r\nand so begins the chase that ends in feast<BR>\r\nwhether it plays tease or cries 'please'<BR>\r\nand both victory and defeat are demise<BR>\r\nwhether your hands seize the prize or are led astray<BR>\r\nthe tears will rain<BR>\r\nlike grains of sand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen one's claws are caught<BR>\r\nin knots of thread<BR>\r\nand every twine leads to dread<BR>\r\nand every threat is dearly-bought<BR>\r\nand stopped in one's construct<BR>\r\nand the ears flop down<BR>\r\nand the fur of your crown is plucked<BR>\r\nlike grains of sand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen the tides recede<BR>\r\nrevealing long-lost days<BR>\r\nand you accede the cost<BR>\r\nand one gaze divides your stealing ways<BR>\r\nand the rind of the eyes wanes<BR>\r\nand the strands of your mind are tossed<BR>\r\nlike grains of sand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen the hunting-time comes<BR>\r\nbetween the day and the night<BR>\r\nand the queen of the stormfront commands 'climb'<BR>\r\nand the cat-shaper scrapes your ears<BR>\r\nand soothes youth's roaming fears<BR>\r\nand your husks come home to dusk's domain<BR>\r\nlike grains of sand.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dunes (Second Book of Sand)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBefore a skull-pile<BR>\r\nClimb with vile or guile<BR>\r\nGrow into Do<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBehind a book-tower<BR>\r\nClimb and scour<BR>\r\nGlow into Jo<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nLeft a safe-hill of leisure<BR>\r\nWaddle with measure<BR>\r\nSlow into Dro<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRight a candy mountain<BR>\r\nDig in, dig in<BR>\r\nFall into Ja<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhich way, which way, Khajiit?<BR>\r\nEvery dune tastes so sweet<BR>\r\nWhere to begin, where to begin?<BR>\r\nClose your eyes and spin<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Seasons (Second Book of Sand)<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nRain, rain, Jo'Jo showers<BR>\r\nSprout, sprout, shadow flowers<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSpring, spring, Senche sun<BR>\r\nBite, bite, battle's done<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nOops!
