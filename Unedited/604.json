If you wish to climb the mountain, walk my path.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"And what good can your path and your mountain of knowledge do me?\" inquired the Clever-Man.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Woodland Man, seemingly surprised, answered: \"You can learn all you wish to learn, solve any problem you wish to solve, and become the wisest of the wise. I invite you to do so. Come, walk with me.\"<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\"No, elf-demon,\" said Athalwyrm, \"I will not take your path, nor will I trust you to guide me. The things that are unknown are much greater than the things that are known, and death is much longer than life. The greater part of the secrets of your realm are useless to me. To learn them would take my whole life, and you would not let me go free in death. I can find all the answers I need in my own clever head that was given to me by Shor.\" So saying, the Clever-Man kept walking and climbed the mountain.<BR><BR>",
