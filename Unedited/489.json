House Indoril itself was formed by the amalgamation of several clans under the leadership of Lord Nerevar Indoril and Lady Almalexia. The formation of this House through a series of small-scale military campaigns led to the rise of other Houses as other Chimer clans sought to protect themselves. However, House Indoril remained the most powerful, controlling the lands from Necrom in the east to the River Thirr in the west and stretching from the Northern Deshaan to the fortress of Ammar in the north.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTriffith was born on the small island of Gorne, which is located off the east coast of Vvardenfell in the Inner Sea. This island held only a small plantation and forest at the birth of Triffith. Throughout his childhood, he worked diligently and virtuously for his clan, helping to tend the crops and catch the fish. However, he also took his lessons very seriously. When he was fifty years of age, he left the island in order to receive more schooling from the priestly orders in Necrom. However, destiny had far greater plans for him than entering the priesthood.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nFrom 1E395 to 1E401, the clans consolidated into the six Great Houses and the island of Gorne was folded into House Indoril under Lord Nerevar. Thus, Triffith became Indoril Triffith, and immediately entered service with House Indoril's forces. An alliance with the Dwemer was soon announced against the degenerate Nords who occupied a huge swathe of the west of Veloth. All of the Great Houses applauded this effort, and the Chimer armies joined the Dwemer constructs in destroying the Nords. Indoril Triffith in particular proved himself a powerful but tempered warrior, and soon was noticed by Lord Nerevar himself. After routing a Nord force several hundred-strong with a Chimer scouting force, Indoril Triffith was awarded the command of several hundred troops and promoted to General. He rapidly rose to the task, orchestrating the destruction of the remainder of the Nordic forces and freeing Veloth from foreign domination.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nLord Nerevar was made leader of the First Council with his Dwemer counterpart, King Dumac, and Veloth was reorganized into the kingdom of Resdayn. After Lord Nerevar's ascension, he tapped General Indoril Triffith to lead the Indoril House armies, elevating the General's family into the nobility of the House. The small plantation was replaced with a mansion and support buildings, and many important decisions were made on this island retreat. During the period of the First Council, the uneasy peace between the Dwemer and Chimer forces was maintained, with little active campaigning except for small scale battles with Nord reavers and Orcish raiders.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHowever, the peace was not to last, as the treacherous Sixth House and Dwemer betrayed Lord Nerevar. The Dwemer were attempting to construct a god, as a mockery of the Chimer faith. House Dagoth turned on Lord Nerevar and invited Nord and Orc mercenaries to attack Resdayn, to destroy the Chimer nation. Lord Nerevar had met with Dumac and been spurned, so resolved to attack the Dwemer, who were predominantly based on Vvardenfell. General Indoril Triffith marshaled the troops and contacted the leaders of the other righteous Chimer Houses, each of which promised to send troops. However, House Indoril, being the largest and most powerful House, had the honor of claiming most of the united Chimer armies as their own. General Indoril Triffith became the practical leader of the forces, while Lord Nerevar and his advisors struggled to hold Resdayn together. Initially the war went badly, with the organized and resourceful Dwemer able to capture much of the north of Resdayn, including all of Vvardenfell. General Triffith decided that the bulk of the army would be marshaled in Narsis, as this was central to the remaining Chimer lands. The united Chimer forces rapidly marched from Narsis to Ebonheart, consolidating the heartland of Resdayn and meeting reinforcements on the way. Indoril Triffith decided that the best strategy would involve a forced march to Red Mountain, in order to face the bulk of the Dwemer forces and cut off the head of the enemy. Lord Nerevar and his councilors agreed, and they accompanied the armies.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Dwemer were very well defended at Red Mountain, using profane weaponry and constructs. Lord Nerevar fooled the Dwemer into leaving their strongholds with a small decoy force, while General Triffith arrayed the bulk of the army out of sight. Lord Nerevar retreated back towards the Chimer lines and the Dwemer followed, as well as the foreign mercenaries. Battle was rapidly joined, with the fighting thickest around General Triffith. The Chimer mages sent fireballs smashing into the Dwemer lines, while Dwemer tone-lords responded with profane energies. The Dwemer forces were heavily armored, but fewer in number than the Chimer. Meanwhile, Lord Nerevar had secretly infiltrated the main Dwemer stronghold with a small contingent of trusted warriors, and confronted Dumac. Dumac was killed, Lord Nerevar mortally wounded, and the Dwemer were destroyed by Azura for the death of most noble Nerevar. On the battlefield, the Dwemer disappeared instantly, leaving only mindless constructs and mercenaries. The Nords and Orcs were rapidly defeated, with General Triffith leading the final charge against the last body of troops. The battle was won easily as the mercenaries were demoralized and confused, while the Chimer were brave and virtuous.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nHowever, the treacherous Sixth House, while defeated, remained a force to be reckoned with. General Triffith ordered that all mer of the Cursed House were to be destroyed, including the women and children. This caused some dissent, as the Hlaalu and Dres believed that the children should be left alive. General Triffith was convinced, and the mer under the age of thirty of the Sixth House were spared. The detritus from the Cursed House was removed and hidden, and the secret of where was lost. General Triffith himself adopted a child of the Sixth House to grow up on the Island of Gorne. He retired to the island for several years, but agreed to take up the mantle of General at the request of the Tribunal, in order to protect the new Temple faith.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe child adopted by the general was named Tay, and was a confident and precocious young man. He excelled at his studies and entertained ideas of entering the priesthood. However, while studying in Mournhold, he was driven mad by the curse of his ancestors and took a name from the Cursed House. He was involved in the deaths of many of his adopted family and their retainers.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSeven years after the battle at Red Mountain, the Cursed House traitor Tay led a small rebellion, proclaiming the rise again of the Sixth House. General Indoril Triffith was at the time meeting with other House leaders near Red Mountain, discussing the allocation of Sixth House lands to the remaining Houses. The young blasphemer broke into the fortress where the meeting was taking place, and attempted to assassinate the noble General. This showed that the General had been right regarding the total destruction of the Sixth House, and acceding to the wishes of the Dres and Hlaalu almost cost him his own life. However, the mad assassin fled and fell into Red Mountain, destroying the fledgling revolt.<BR> \\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nGeneral Indoril Triffith continued to lead the armies of House Indoril until his retirement in 1E768, to allow his niece Indoril Baynarah to assume supreme command of the Indoril warriors. He lived on Gorne for the remainder of his life, meeting visiting dignitaries, and enjoying the simple physical work of his childhood. He passed away quietly in 1E802, and was interred in Necrom. His spirit was devoted to the Ghostfence upon its construction, protecting Resdayn from the menace of the Sixth House once more.<BR>","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":35,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
