From my research many Reachmen do not always cast spells within the moment of ritual, but instead use a minor ritual (often sacrificial and self-destructive, as is the case of all wild and untamed magicks not sanctioned by the guild) to ready a spell mid-cast. Upon need of such spell they simply must loosen the magickal seal to unleash the casted spell. This, like all things in Reach-Magic, can be incredibly damaging to the spell host, as many spell types are not designed for internal use -- let alone being internally withheld for days, months, or even years.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nA Reachmen's ritual is not always cast before release, however. Another form of Reach-Magic can be observed through the effects it has on the surrounding areas. There have been numerous reports of droughts, earthquakes, and various curses happening in the lands where witchmen have practiced their magicks, as if the ground itself was seeped in a magickal muck of curses. Unlike the scholars of the officially recognized schools of magic practiced by the esteemed Guild of Mages, which aims to control the forces of which we command through spell, these magicks instead seek to take hold of said forces and manipulate through unknown means without proper protection. As if the damaging effects of such reckless behavior could in any way outweigh the caster's own soul and body.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSome less familiar scholars liken Reach-Magic to some form of Mysticism, as both practices tend to revolve around the unseen nature of Mundus, as well as often invoking magicks unknown, replicating the unprecedented effects of wild innovation. However, these academics seem to misinterpret the intentions of such schools of thought. My understanding of differences between both of these wide fields of study can be best described as such; While Mysticism is understanding and replicating the results of magicks gone sometimes horribly wrong, Reach-Magic, in many of its various forms, relies on magicks that have gone horribly right.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWith all of this in mind, it's no wonder why the late Empress Morihatha Septim had deemed this vile form of spellcraft illegal. Reach-Magic is as dangerous as they come, to both the caster and their surroundings. Even were one to call upon such rituals without negative consequences, there can be no guarantee of how, why, or if it will work. If you wish to learn the inner workings of magick, then I would suggest joining your nearest Mages Guild where you can practice proper magical theory and execution, rather than learning from some common Reachmen in the forest.<BR>","data":{"weight":2.5,"value":50,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
