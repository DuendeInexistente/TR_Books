None remember what they fought over, for their love to come was so great it overshadowed all rivalries or disputes. They fought to a standstill, as their followers looked on - till her sword broke his axe and his shield dulled her blade and all could see that they were equals.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs the Eagle finds its mates, so too did Fjori find hers in Holgeir, and a time of peace came to the clans of the forest. But as the summer's warmth gives way to winter's chill, so too would this peace pass.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut the Snake came and bit Holgeir, its venom seeping deep into the wound.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nA Whale greeted Fjori's view as she came over the snow-covered mountains to the coast.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nShe obtained an elixir from the Akavir and returned to the forest in haste.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThough Holgeir could smell the winds of Sovngarde, she gave him the elixir and he was cured in an instant.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut the Snake bit Fjori as she poured the last drop into Holgeir's mouth, and fatigued from her journey, she joined the ancestors immediately.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHolgeir's grief was such that he built a tomb and upon completion, took his own life that he might rejoin her.<BR>\r\n<BR>","data":{"weight":3.0,"value":30,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
