You can only make out a few.]<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n16, Last Seed<BR>\\r\\nOlgol hate damn Furnius. Proud Orc Leginarre serving great Emperor not meant to polish blades! Maybe he just making me mad, so I more better when I needed to smash bandits.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n20, Last Seed<BR>\\r\\nNo smashing, but now I scrub floors? It not proper! If I had rank, I make Furnius scrub floor with head! But making floor pretty not going to help me do that. . .<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n1 Hearthfire<BR>\\r\\nSome people think Orcs idiots and savages. But they are fools. Maybe I not as smart as Telvanni wizard, but I can write and read. Smarty Legionarre like Furnius should know better. I fix his wagon. Just need Plan. Like drop something heavy on his head when he make me change candles on shandoleer. If Furnius dead, I think I go up in rank.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n5 Hearthfire<BR>\\r\\nPlan not work. Miss Furnius, and make him angry. Now I have to fix floor stones I broke too. Damn! Need better Plan. . . I know I need Plan, but I need better one than I made. Can't ask for help. That treason. . . Maybe a spell. . .<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n17 Hearthfire<BR>\\r\\nAfter much practice, I believe I have produced a reasonably effective spell to make myself more intelligent. Though after my experimentation, I realize that the effect will eventually wear off. And so I am left with a small puzzle: While I can undoubtedly come up with a foolproof plan, how do I go about making the plan simple enough for me to understand once I become invetiably duller? I cannot escape the feeling that, even if I were to cast the spell just prior to rereading the plan, it would not last long enough for me to see the plan through. And so I would probably, after much quiet brilliance, simply draw my axe in confused enthusiasm and try to kill smug Furnius. And be executed. I no understand plan. At least, I think that plan I wrote when smart. It end with \"executed\". That not good plan. I try again tomorrow.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n18 Hearthfire<BR>\\r\\nI think I have arrived at a solution. Killing Furnius is now out of the question, as is apparent from yesterday's entry. More important is keeping myself alive. I fear that if I do not formulate a satisfactory plan soon, I will have to rely on myself not becoming frustrated enough to kill Furnius outright. And I cannot rely on that. And thus my solution: To keep myself alive, I must turn myself in to the guards. I have plotted murder, but failing to fulfill those plans, I might escape the gallows. Rolling the dice in that way is surely better than depending on my own limited intellect. The contents of these notes should be enough to have me jailed. So, keeping it simple. . .<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Plan:<BR>\\r\\n- Give guard book. He help.<BR>\\r\\n- Keep axe home. Guard do all work.<BR>\\r\\n- Do what guard say. He help you follow good plan.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n[This was the last entry. Apparently, Olgol's plan worked] <BR>\\r\\n",
