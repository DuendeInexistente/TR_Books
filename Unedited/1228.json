The streets of Anvil have been buzzing with talk of the Black Isle Company, a distributor of goods from Vvardenfell island which has made waves off the back of a seemingly endless stock run. The mania surrounding the company has grown to the point where brokers speak of paupers, some with the very clothes falling off their backs, demanding a share of the company in exchange for what little they have to their name. Indeed, to hear some speak of it, the Black Isle Company seems not to be a company at all, but an infinite font of wealth by which one can convert even a small sum into a fortune. This all begs a simple question: what has it done to earn its success?<BR><BR>\\r\\nIn an effort to shed light on the situation, the Monitor sat down with a company representative for questions. The somewhat scattered interview that followed painted an image of an ambitious company in the midst of growing pains. Grandiose in its vision, the Black Isle Company has seemingly relegated 'viability' and 'internal consistency' to secondary concerns.<BR><BR>\\r\\nWith this in mind, the idea that it could ever succeed should seem laughable. And yet, having not even received its first full batch of goods from Vvardenfell, its potential appears limitless. The high value commanded by Dark Elven commodities in Cyrodiil is no secret. Many a trader has pleaded for the day when the East Empire Company loosens its hold on Morrowind for just a moment. And a growing number believe that it will be the Black Isle Company which finally answers their prayers.<BR><BR>\\r\\nIf they're correct, then the concept behind the Black Isle Company is too perfect -- too natural and anticipated and 'right' -- to fail, no matter how mismanaged it is. The Company's leadership certainly seems eager to test this theory. But if, on the other hand, the Black Isle Company is merely an economic enterprise, then its fundamentals simply do not bear out against the public's enormous expectations for it.<BR>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
