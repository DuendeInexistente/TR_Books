One of the Good Daedra is looking upon you with favor, if only you are prepared to accept their aid. The Apprentice will unwittingly show you the way.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE LOVER - SUN'S DAWN<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nBeware those who are attracted by your elegance, yet seek only to fulfill their own desires. Stay with friends who have proven their worth time and again, for they will remain steadfast. Should The Serpent cross your path, you must decide quickly if they are friend or foe.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE LORD - FIRST SEED<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nYour strength and health are worthless if you don't put them to use. Take a risk and try something new! Seek out a companion in The Lady, but stay clear of The Tower, for they provide false support.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE MAGE - RAIN'S HAND<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nYour talents will sadly remain under-appreciated, but those who recognize them will be your true friends. Remember that there are many forms of magic, some more subtle than others. The Ritual will cast a spell upon you that you won't see coming.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE SHADOW - SECOND SEED<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nDarkness approaches and the shadows grow longer, bringing more lurking danger, but also more opportunities to conceal your actions. Both The Apprentice and The Mage will offer to teach you a lesson, but choose carefully, for only one may be your teacher.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE STEED - MIDYEAR<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nSlow down! It may be hard for you to do, but you will miss a life-changing event if you do not. When your patience is at an end, look to The Lord for guidance, for they will guard your path.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE APPRENTICE - SUN'S HEIGHT<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nYou've known your whole life that you have a reckless gift for magic, but you have an unexplored talent that carries the same risks...and rewards. The Atronach may seem to be a reflection of your worst qualities, but if only given the chance will become a loyal friend.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE WARRIOR - LAST SEED<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nRemember that you protect your loved ones through all your weapons, whether of metal, magic, or mind. They'll be counting on you this year. The Steed will be your ally, but only if you can control your temper long enough to forgive them for their shortcomings.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE LADY - HEARTFIRE<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nPeople praise you for your kindness and tolerance, but beware of The Lover who seeks to take advantage of your compassion. When their deception is revealed, redemption may still be possible, but not by your hands.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE TOWER - FROSTFALL<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nKeep trying to unlock the heart of the one you admire. Persistence will reward you with a treasure more valuable than gold. Should you find that all is lost, seek out The Thief, who may have found the key.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE ATRONACH - SUN'S DUSK<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nUninvited visitors wait patiently for the moment when you have given all you have, and will hurt you deeply if you remain defenseless. There is no shame in asking for help, and The Warrior gives you the best chance of survival.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE THIEF - EVENING STAR<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nTragedy approaches the place you call home, but taking a risk to keep your loved ones safe will always pay off. The Ritual will prepare you, so long as they receive something in return.\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\r\\nTHE SERPENT<BR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAs always, you are an enigma that defies every stargazer's attempt to divine your path. While an uncertain future may be terrifying, it is also freeing to live apart from the influence of the stars. You control of your destiny; go live your life as you see fit!\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":10,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
