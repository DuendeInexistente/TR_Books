This follows an extended period of time during which the Argonian had secluded himself in his chambers, supposedly working on a grand experiment. Yuaile Phyroc, a local enchanter who alerted us to this story, had this to say: \"Tarhiel's ideas are sometimes a little over the top, but I hope this discovery of his will jump start a new era of magical research and help our city's glory reach new heights!\"<br><br>","data":{"weight":0.2,"value":1,"book_type":"Scroll","skill":"None","enchantment":0}}
