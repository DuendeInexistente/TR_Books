Here we explore the twisted lies of these Imperial fools and their bizarre notion of equality between the various races that comprise their precious Tamrielic Empire.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe principal tenet that the abolitionists stake their claims on is that beast races are no less intelligent than the other races. While it may not be true that humans are more intelligent than Argonians or Khajiit, it is clear that the Dunmer are superior in every respect. The native population of Argonia consists of tiny villages eking an existence out of a fetid swamp. Literacy is unknown and art unheard of; they build primitive hovels that subside quickly into the jungle when their brief, harsh, unremarkable lives come to an end. In summary, their lives have no more importance than the nix-hounds we dine on. The Khajiit live in small shacks in an arid wasteland littered with the remains of greater and now extinct societies. They huddle in these ruins in awe of what once was, but is no more. Let us contrast these failings to the achievements of the Dunmer nation; we have built cities that have endured since time beyond remembrance, and even the poorest amongst us can read and comprehend the public discourse that is occurring around them. The lives of the Dunmer people have historical merit compared to the lives of the beasts, and our achievements echo forever through history.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe second tenet of abolitionist doctrine is that slaves are happier when they have been freed of their bonds. This idea that freedom is a virtue is a quaint but untrue notion. An Argonian without a master will perform no tasks, so how is it to survive? It is true that it will work to acquire food and a dry place out of the rain, but then so will the common guar, and no one is suggesting that we should set our guar herds free. Clearly Argonians do not have higher aspirations for their meager lives and are better served by having a set task. In doing it, they receive a dry place to sleep and adequate food to eat. Furthermore, society looks down on a free Argonian, providing the beast with no opportunities for work and leading it down the path to starvation and death. As for the Khajiit, they are so addled by a lust for the moonsugar that they would waste away and die without the constant supervision of a Dunmer master. Their propensity to commit crimes is also a grave concern that abolitionist rhetoric completely ignores, to their great loss.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nAnother point of contention that we have with the abolitionist, n'wah, is the idea that beastfolk desire freedom. It is most unlikely that any of these abolitionists have asked a slave if it wants to be free, and even if they have, the answer is of no consequence. We can ask our pack guars if they want to be free by opening their pens and allowing them to escape. The guar's answer will always be no, because it knows that working for its master leads to food, water, and shelter. What is true of one beast is also true of many beasts, and so it is with Argonians and Khajiit.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe fourth argument the abolitionists make is much more esoteric than its predecessors and is predicated on the Imperial notion that the strong do not have the privilege to exploit those who are feeble and pathetic. Of course this idea is subverted by historical truth at nearly every turn; a society cannot exist if those with authority do not find a way to encourage those without it to do their bidding. Slavery is the logical extension of this historical fact and to deny ourselves access to it would be an attempt to rewrite the rules by which our world has operated for generations. It is most amusing that the beasts themselves have little understanding or appreciation for the abolitionist's line of argument in this respect; they do not understand how it would aid them in escaping the bonds of slavery, further proof of our right to enslave every beast.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nIt should now be evident why it is the duty of all Dunmer to resist the abolitionist Imperials at every turn. This is not only something we must do out of self-interest, but something we must do in the interest of the beastfolk as well.<BR>","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":50,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
