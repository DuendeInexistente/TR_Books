Nothing could grow there, and nothing could change.<BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nChange and growth were foreign to the Beginning Place. It was void of such things as change and growth.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nThe Divines, great spirits, had entered this place fully formed and within their power, but the lesser spirits of mortal men were pale and feeble things.<BR>\\r\\nPale and feeble were the spirits of mortal men, their souls neither vivid nor strong.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nThe Divines then took pity on these lesser souls, who would never become as great, wise, and full of power as they are.<BR>\\r\\nGreat, and wise, and powerful are the Divines, and in their power they took pity on us.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nLed by the spirit Shezarr, they set about building the World as a house in which mortal souls could grow, by trial and sorrow.<BR>\\r\\nBy trial and sorrow we are born, by trial and sorrow we die, and this was the idea of Shezarr.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nMany lesser spirits contributed to this great work, they became part of the World entirely. It was a long and difficult labor.<BR>\\r\\nLong and difficult was their labor, the labor of those we have forgotten.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nOther spirits refused the labor, pleased as they were with their own lot, or covetous of the power the great and enduring Divines possessed.<BR>\\r\\nThey who are pleased do not covet, they who covet are not pleased. Beware of spirits that are pleased yet covet.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nStill other spirits gladly contributed, but at the hour they grew afraid, for there was a price to pay for the making, and not all were willing to pay it.<BR>\\r\\nNot all were willing, not all are wont to pay the price. Let them flee, for their star-eyes are the prize of Shezarr.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nFor it is said that the Divines gave freely of themselves, and they were thus forever diminished within the making of the World.<BR>\\r\\nForever diminished in the making, so freely did they give flesh, blood, and bone.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nWith their flesh they fed us, with their blood they washed us, with their bones they spoke to us in the World their creation.<BR>\\r\\nThe World their creation, bones speaking, blood washing, flesh feeding.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nThen the Divines departed for Aetherius, the place outside of the world, where all things that die aspire to go.<BR>\\r\\nTo the place of death the Divines went, but not into death, into the world of the dead above us.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nBut the Divines were mindful of their children, and left behind signs and mirages to guide and protect the wandering souls.<BR>\\r\\nSigns and mirages to guide and protect, in the sky, the earth, and the temples of Man.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nLook to the sky, where the planets whirl in omen. They are signs of the Divines, arms outstretched to the center of the World.<BR>\\r\\nTheir paths in the heavens are omens of things to come.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nListen to the earth, whispering in solace. The Divines are there also, their essence a piece of the self they left behind.<BR>\\r\\nThrough the world of trial there leads a virtuous path for us to follow.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nObey the temples of the spirits, and the temples of law. Listen to the saints and oracles, for their word is the wisdom of the Divines.<BR>\\r\\nStudy the Covenants, for they will not lead you astray.<BR>\\r<BR>\\nFor it is in Divine sacrifice that we learn the true essence of the Divines.<BR>\\r\\nSacrifice is the true essence of the Divines.<BR>",
