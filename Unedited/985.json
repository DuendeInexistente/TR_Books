House Hlaalu is strong, widespread, wealthy, and noted for its ambitious proliferation into Vvardenfell; we are a house of peacemakers, if anything, and we are a house of Mer who seek above all to raise the quality of life for all the denizens of Morrowind. Our nobles lead all of the houses in bringing the benefits of Imperial trade from the Cyrodiilic coffers to the hands of the common people: in our lands, no man is in want of food or gold. By virtue of faith in the emperors, we can raise the Dunmer out of the darkness of their bloody, ash-swept past and into the light of catholic civilization, to the betterment of all. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIt is no mystery that the men of House Hlaalu are not warriors in their hearts; we pride ourselves on our tact and grace, speechcraft and politesse. War is a costly thing, in money and Mer, and House Hlaalu has always been firmly opposed to it. Why make war, ask we, when one can make money? War taxes and tears at our economy, starving the people of both food in their stomachs and faith in their leaders. War is a crude and brutal thing of a time now past; let us embrace the future with daring, trading goods instead of evils. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Imperial forces mustered for a grand assault upon the lands of Dunmereth, and House Hlaalu, foreseeing the wisdom of the Tribunal, insisted upon a peaceful integration, seeing no good to come of a prolonged and violent conflict that could destroy our beloved realm by cruel attrition. We welcomed the Empire and all the good that came with it: in a word, freedom, and more than we have ever had before. With Cyrodiil's ships in our quays, the world was open to us a clam yielding a pearl, and that pearl was the bounty of all of Tamriel; not only had we our lives and our worship, but now all the goods of a thousand lands and peoples, enriching every aspect of our day-to-day subsistence. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUnfortunately, not all have seen this, but the Hlaalu mind is proliferating with its people as trade routes dig deeper through Morrowind and into the Empire. We hope that the other houses may find it meet to put down their weapons and pick up the tools of fine craftsmanship, that their common folk may finally know a life of comfort and grace, rather than ceaseless toil and arduous miseries. Until then, Hlaalu opens its shops and lands to any who wish to partake of its bounty. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDo not let opportunity pass by; do not cleave to the wretchedness of the past in the name of tradition. Veloth the Prophet did not bring us to Morrowind to suffer; he brought us that we might know a better way of life. A better way of life is calling, friends. Are we not the Chimer, the changed folk? Then know that the winds of change blow once again, and he who refuses them refuses to be a part of the vision of his ancestors. Remember Veloth, and remember Vivec: Hlaalu is the future of the Dunmer.<BR>\r\n","data":{"weight":2.0,"value":30,"book_type":"Book","skill":"None","enchantment":100}}
