When the children of Veloth wandered orphaned in the Ashland wastes, it was the Indoril knights that founded Mournhold and brought the itinerant Chimer into civilized Houses; when the Nords came from Skyrim with axes and storms, it was our warriors under Almalexia that staved off their assaults; when the Deep Elves wrought a god of blasphemy, it was the army of Serjo Indoril Nerevar Mora that spearheaded the crusade; when the Temple called for men-at-arms, Indoril pledged itself so fully that behind nigh-on every Ordinator's helm there is the keen face of one of our own. An Outlander asks what a Dunmer is, and learned men point to House Indoril. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWe have not swerved from this path in the slightest. Now, we protect our people with the authority of the Tribunal, blessed ALMSIVI; we are the spiritual power of Morrowind. The Ordinators in all their Orders never fail to hunt out necromancers, destroy creatures of the blight, keep the Ghostfence intact, and most importantly of all, protect the right of every Dunmer to worship and receive the blessings of the Holy Tribunal, the gods who walk among us. It was made clear from the instant an Imperial sandal touched the grass of our lands: in spite of all that may come, Indoril will see to it that no Dunmer must bow to an alien god, nor surrender his honor to the whims of invaders. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWhen Tiber Septim made himself manifest in Morrowind, the warriors of Indoril sent his armies into Oblivion; we slew them like netch of the Wastes, reaped them like wickwheat crop. They came to bend us, and in turn our gods bent them: no deity may withstand the Tribunal, the gods who walk among us. We had faith, and we had victory. For nigh on a century, Indoril steel spilt Imperial blood; their redness ran like wine in the fields of Morrowind, and flowed to the borders of the Inner Sea. And then Vivec, the warrior-poet, master of all things, wrought peace. Even then, the vigil of Indoril did not cease; wherever an Imperial hand deigned to hold back a Dunmer, we were there to stop the heinous deed. Even now we wear our colors into their midst; we let them pray to their divines while we see the very faces of our gods. Let them do as they will; Indoril will not forget what it is to be Dunmer. Indoril will never be anything but the truest of Dunmer. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nWith us stand the Redoran, our brothers-in-arms, keepers of the Ghostgate, and warrior kin. With honor the line of Retherein held the western marches, and still does in Vvardenfell. They were Redoran mercenaries that stiffened the militias mustered in defiance of the Emperor; they are never lax in their devotion to the Tribunal. Neither will Dres forget the ways of old, nor the hours in which together we repelled the barbarian invaders, felling them by rank and file; they have the blessings of the Tribunal, their worship so strong. <BR>\\r\\n<BR>\\r\\nThe Temple gifts us life, protects us from harm; and it is Indoril that gifts the Temple life, protects it from harm. Cleave always to your heritage and the Tribunal will bless you, and Indoril will keep you. Remember the Seven Graces, and be right. The Imperials cannot touch he in whom Veloth dwells; that is the core of our being. That is the truth of being Dunmer.<BR>\\r\\n",
